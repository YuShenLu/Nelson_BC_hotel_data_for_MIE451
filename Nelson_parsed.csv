It looked to us like they had thicker glass in the windows, muffling street sounds to the minimum.  This, with well-functioning blackout curtains, combined with the most comfortable BW beds we've ever experienced, made for a very restful night. Although the rooms are not spacious, they are well appointed, nicely lit, and the furniture is nicer than it looks in photos. The bathroom is good, but lacking counter space and a fan. There is no pool, but there is a small hot tub as part of the small fitness centre. They could also use more TV stations like The Frame channel and\u002For Stingray \u002F Galaxy music channels.

This might sound strange but one of our favorite parts of the place was the shower with its very generous flow of water, a nice contrast to all-too-many places nowadays.\n\nThe grounds are very suitable for young children and families.  There is a neat tree deck, like a tree house without walls and a roof, built under a large, beautiful spruce where you can sit and relax.\n\nMolly, who takes care of running the breakfast room, does a great job.  She's very friendly and also makes a very nice omelet. We enjoyed our chat with her the two mornings we were there.  (She'll probably ask you to be sure to put a pin in the map to show where you are from, too.)\n\nTo sum up, I'd say a visit there is very much like visiting a good friend's nice lake house.

The room was stark with a hodge podge of old furniture, a terrible bed, internet that did not work and a minuscule TV. There was not a comfortable place to sit in the room leaving one to sit on the bed that had no headboard and wanted to roll away from the wall.  The bathroom was dirty and the location was nowhere near as nice as advertised. Yes it is near downtown but the \""view of the lake\"" was a joke. What one could see was a sliver of the lake over the dog pound across the street!  \nYes there was a kitchenette but not even a coffee maker in the room so plan on hiking downtown if you want a morning brew. They advertise like a bed and breakfast but do not be fooled, no breakfast here and nary a sign of management. They tell you that the key will be left in the room but fail to mention that there are no names to identify the upstairs rooms so one is left wandering around peering in windows to see if the room is occupied or not! No management on site.\nThe  front yard is pleasant enough but the backyard is all pavement and overlooks decrepit buildings with the side yard having a \""great view\"" of the Nelson animal control shelter.\nNelson is wonderful but there are far nicer places to stay so my advice is to avoid this place.\n$120\u002Fnite for a bad nights sleep is just too much.",2,negative,"August 9, 2010",203 Victoria St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4K2

Each of the desk clerks were pleasant and helpful, there are a couple of luggage carts and an elevator to access all rooms.

Pamphlets in the room indicated you could order different pillows, and schedule your room cleaning service (an offer of which we took advantage). There is the usual ice machine and drink dispensers, an office area on the balcony of the lobby, and apparently there is a hot tub, which I do not recall before.  Some rooms face into a tiny courtyard, but they have painted a big mural on the wall opposite the room windows, and provided potted shrubs to make the view more appealing.  I believe before they shared the parking lot across the street and finding space was a problem.  Now they own the lot and control parking in front of the hotel; the inn was full of skiers the weekend we arrived but there was plenty of room to park.  The grill next door hasn't changed much but provides a solid if usual breakfast but I thought the service was very good.

The hotel is rectangular, with an inner set of rooms which look into one another. The outer rooms are described as having a view. If you are on your bed, you do get a nice view of mountains. However, if you are standing, you see either a car park, or a rail yard.

It is an attractive, colourful hotel and the staff are definitely very friendly and helpful.  As we were only staying one night and needed two beds and no kitchen, we went with Room 32 (if I remember correctly) due to the $94 price.  In comparison a full room with two Queens and a kitchen was $119.  In hindsight we would happily have paid an extra $25 for a proper sized room with more amenities and hopefully better quality finishing.  This one looked like a basement suite with pretty low quality finishing.\n\nThis room had a small fridge sitting on the floor in a corner with a microwave on top of it and a coffee pot on top of that, with a power bar sitting on the floor out ion the open with various items plugged into it.  There is no fan in the bathroom and the toilet is less than 8 feet from the person's head in the double bed, which can be a bit awkward for both the person using the bathroom and the person in the bed.  Also, the manager's suite is above this room and we could hear them using their bathroom during the night.\n\nThere is a locked door to a connecting room which must have the TV located on the other side of the door because even though it was not turned up loud, we could easily hear it anywhere in the room.  It was a warm night but the air conditioner is a low budget model and made far too much noise to leave on.  It would have been too loud for us to sleep and would likely have disturbed people in nearby rooms. \n\nFinally when we went to check out in the morning we discovered that the office did not open until 8:00, which we thought was a little late, so we had to leave without a proper check out.\n\nSo a nice looking little hotel with pleasant staff but a not-so-great experience due to the room.

We walked in the mornings and evenings for our breakfast and dinner. Very convenient to hit a pub and walk back without worrying about driving or taxi. We choose Alpine Inn over other downtown hotels primarily  due to the parking. Other hotels in down town don't have the same parking as Alpine. One has to find and pay for city parking compared to extremely convenient front of the room parking at Alpine Inn. And we think we made the right choice and were very happy with our choice.

The gal who checked us in was most accommodating, and was very kind as she answered the many questions we had about the town, etc.  \n\nHowever, once we got to our room we were very disappointed as it was not at all the same as in the pictures. It upsets me when places only show their nicest rooms, with no mention at all about what the room is like that you are actually getting. It was old, and not well kept. The carpets were very stained and dirty, with a mildew smell that came out as we walked through the room. The worst part was what we saw when the cover fell off the front of the little room air conditioner - this was after we couldn't understand why we were feeling stuffy, both had terribly sore throats, and my son had a nasty nosebleed. The air conditioning unit was absolutely filthy! Full of wadded up dust and dirt, with a horrible moldy smell. We immediately shut it off. It clearly had not been cleaned in an extremely long time! \n\nThe room was very hot so we opened the window hoping to cool down a bit, which worked fine until the smell of marijuana came wafting into the room from the people in the rooms next to us who were smoking right in front of their rooms. Not at all pleasant, especially having my young son with me. \n\nThe only upgrade to the room was the bathroom.  I never mind finding cute, older places as long as they are well kept.  This certainly was not it!  Some of the rooms must be much nicer, so be sure you ask if you are getting a room that looks like the picture.  Also be sure to pull the cover off your air conditioner to be certain it is clean. Otherwise, you will be breathing in years of moldy dirt. \n\nAlso, the parking is not good in the evening after the guests have all arrived. We were lucky enough to get the last spot, and watched the next person come in with no place to park. Numbered spaces would be good so each guest at least has one designated parking space. Guests had unhooked and parked their trailers, etc., in front of other rooms, which left guests having to park away from their rooms and maneuver around the trailers to bring their things to their own rooms.  \n\nAll that said, I want to say again how kind the staff was.

When we inquired about another room we were advised there is one with a bunk bed available all 3 nights. We looked at this room but it was too small.

The hotel was built in the early 1900's and has been newly renovated.  The owners have done an amazing job with the reno's but instead of going \""heritage\"" they have gone with a clean modern theme - loved it!  We stayed in an \""economy\"" room which is their mid-level room. Our very clean room included a queen bed, air conditioning, small flat screen TV, free wi-fi and full bath. Right outside our room was the common area with lots of seating, eating area and a small fridge which would be awesome if you are traveling with a large group or sports team. Our economy room also provided us with access to the roof top patio but not access to the gym or sauna.  Upon entering our room, I immediately regretted not bringing pillows from home, two flat little pillows were all that were there.  A trip to the front desk to ask if there was any way to get two more pillows was immediately met with two fluffy pillows.  Judging by the difference in pillow quality, thinking we got \""deluxe\"" pillows.  The next morning, after leaving the shower, I searched high and low for a hair drier but couldn't find one.  I mentioned to the manager when checking out that the hair drier was missing.  Apparently, it wasn't missing but intentionally left out; only deluxe rooms get one.  I could have called down and \""requested one\"" and they would be happy to bring one up.  I certainly understand the desire to provide \""extras\"" for the higher price deluxe rooms but come on, a hair drier is basic.  Thumbs down to whoever made this petty decision.

We arrived on a Friday early evening and were told \""We have a few spots out back, but they fill up quickly with people drinking in our bar\"". All the metered spots in front of the hotel were full too, so I had to drive around to find a spot and pay for parking.\n*Limited family-dining options.

My wife had several places listed but I made the decision to stay at The Adventure Hotel because it was close to everything.\n\nStaff was nice and friendly and very helpful.\n\nFrom the outside the building is very nice and modern looking.  Parking is a bit of a challenge though as they only have a few spots available in the back but fortunately we were able to find one spot left so we grabbed it right away.  The only room they had available was a single suite but thats OK with us because we don't have any kids and we only need a place to crash for the night.\n\nThe whole hotel is very nice inside and looks like it was updated recently.  Must say we were quite impressed.  They have a lounge area just off the Hotel lobby where you can hang out and have a drink.  The lobby is beautifully decorated with a nice fireplace and a wall fountain.  Got some nice pictures of it too.\n\nWe got a room on the 2nd floor.  Just a FYI they don't have an elevator so you need to use the stairs.  We don't mind this because we always like to get exercise when we can just want to mention this for people who may come with a full pack of luggage.\n\nOur room was small and to our surprise they actually had a bunk bed in it.  I haven't seen a bunk bed since being a kid.  We could fit in the lower level but my wife likes to sleep in so I took the top bunk.  Must admit we both got a good night sleep.  Maybe TAH is on to something here.  Hahaha.  However on a serious note our room was nicely decorated with modern fixtures and was very nice and clean.  For couples with kids I strongly recommend going with their largest room though as they are smaller than most other hotels.  Also we had to share a shower with other patrons.  We didn't mind this but just wanted to mention for others.\n\nSome other good things to mention is the coffee bar located in the middle area.  They serve Kootenay Coffee every morning.  They have a nice patio located down the hall on the other side.  It's a real nice patio with a sauna on the deck but you need to be a deluxe guest holder to use it.  Need a workout?  They have a gym where you can work out.  They have a treadmill and other cardio machines available.  There was some old school bars with weights on the end too for doing curls.  I found this kind of strange to have such old school weights mixed with modern cardio equipment.  They would be better having free weights on a bench.  Those bars take up WAYYYY to much room but that's just my opinion.

There were windows in the bedroom and sitting area, but they opened onto public areas, so the blinds must be drawn, making the room a bit dark. The room was meticulously clean, with new carpet and paint; AC and mini-refrigerator in the sitting area, but no in-room safe. The bathroom was small, but with new fixtures; the water temperature in the shower, however, fluctuated in an annoying way. There were sitting areas on the balcony in front of the room, and a picnic area below on the grass. \n\nThe motel's biggest drawback was its continental breakfast.

It started with a technical issue with booking.com when I went to book this hotel online.  Ended up reserving a room here for 4 nights, with my 2.5 year old son, directly with the hotel manager. Because of the problems I was having with booking.com I was advised by the hotel manager that it\u2019s always best to book with hotels directly (remember this as it will be relevant in the end).  I was made aware over the phone that they had a queen room available the 1st night, but will need to move us to a different room the 2nd night. But the 3rd and 4th nights the queen room is available  and no moving required. Coming back on the 3rd day after exploring the city, we were told that we may have to move rooms again tomorrow based on whether people booking online request our room. According to the owner who explained this to me and was impatient and down right obnoxious, wondering why I couldn\u2019t understand this, people who book online gets priority to those who book directly with the hotel (remember my earlier comment regarding my conversation which contradicts this completely).  No hotels I\u2019ve stayed at has ever practiced this ridiculous policy.   Needless to say we checked into a different hotel for our 4th night. Closer to center and better customer service for almost the same price. \nBrief info on the hotel:\n1. Indoor Pool is cold and hot tub Luke warm. \n2. Breakfast in the office.  No tables. Chairs against counters by window.  Consists of waffles, muffins, milk, juice, yogurt and cereal. \n3.

Both 2nd and 3rd room in the main building.\n4. Owner rude, belligerent and untrustworthy. Claims to be going out of his way to help but really was just reserving us rooms that was available, charging us more than online prices but will claim to be giving us a deal, and shoved us around like we didn\u2019t matter. \nI can deal with mediocre accommodation but the rudeness, ill mannered, poorly managed business will not elicit me to promote this establishment to friends, families, or strangers.",1,negative,"July 1, 2019",655 3a Hwy,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 6M6

We stayed there two consecutive nights recently.\n\nThere are a few things we look for in a good B&B: location, comfort, accommodation, hospitality, friendliness, and, of course, the breakfast.  \n\nAs for location, the Cloudside is located on one of the upper roads within Nelson, within walking distance to the major strip of business.  We found easy walking access to shops and food options.  Parking throughout most of Nelson, including in front of the Cloudside, is metered except for nights and weekends.  But for the Cloudside there is also parking (which is actually more convenient) around back in an alleyway exclusive for guests.  So, parking and access to the town was very convenient.  \n\nWe stayed in the Aspen room, which featured a queen bed.  We found the room comfortable and provided a good night's rest.  The bathroom for the Aspen was \""private\"" (for our exclusive use) but is accessed by a hallway shared by other rooms.  This makes it slightly inconvenient to use the bathroom, as you have to cover up sufficiently to get there.  The bathroom featured a combination shower\u002Ftub and the toilet.  All rooms are very clean and relatively newly furnished.\n\nOut back there is a deck we used one afternoon to get in a little reading.  The desk and chairs were comfortable, but lacked much of a view.  There is also a small common living room next to the dining area.\n\nWhen we checked in to the Cloudside on the first day, we were greeted by a very friendly staff member who showed us the general layout of the place and provided us keys to our room.  There are two staff members who work there, and both were friendly and accommodating.\n\nBreakfasts were provided, varied by day, and were very good. Breakfasts were served at a single, common dining table, and were served by one of the staff members.  (I think the owners may have cooked the breakfasts...  I'm not really sure, as they didn't make an appearance at the breakfasts.)\n\nWe interacted with the owners only once briefly during our two night stay, and that was mostly by accident.

It was our first time to Nelson and we decided to try the Cloudside as it had such good reviews on Trip Advisor. And I'm happy to say we were not disappointed! We stayed in the Cedar Room which is at the front of the house. I've never stayed anywhere where the bathroom was not ensuite and I was a little hesitant about that but it was fine. The Cedar Room has a dedicated bathroom just down the hall so no worries about walking in on anyone else in the middle of the night! The bathroom was spotless and it was so well stocked with whatever you might need, in full-sized bottles no less!The room was large and spotless as well and the queen bed was very comfortable. The Cloudside is more of an inn than a traditional B&B and has about 7 or 8 rooms. Surprisingly we didn't hear a peep from anyone. The house must have great soundproofing. Children are welcome too and there were some there when we stayed but, again, not a peep. Parking is out the back and makes it very easy to bring your bags in. One thing I REALLY liked is that they have two sittings for breakfast, 8 & 9. I like to sleep in a bit so that was nice. The first morning we had breakfast with only 2 other people and the second morning, the table was full. The breakfasts were delicious and Chris is quite the pastry man and both days we had either fresh muffins or fresh scones. Delicious! The location of the Cloudside is great too. So close to downtown and there is a wonderful coffee bar\u002Frestaurant just on the corner.

It has a lovely quality of 'home' about it - you can leave your shoes on mats at the doors and we chose to do so, padding about in bare feet. I love the fact that there is a large communal table for breakfasts, which in itself encourages chatting with your fellow guests. Everyone we met was friendly and interesting, and it was a great way to start the day (even though we chose the later breakfast time, enjoying the luxury of a delayed start to the day!). Sally and Chris are lovely people, they run the B&B immaculately, down to the last detail. I just wish we could've chatted with them a bit more, a tall order I know for a busy business. The room, Aspen, was a great choice for us, our private bathroom was just down the hall and we had quick access to the back deck. The view is more of the houses across the back lane rather than across the Uphill residential area but you can see the mountains in the background. There was a thoughtful amount of seating at the front and back of the house for an evening glass of wine or even some take-out dinner. The house couldn't have been better situated, we rolled in off the main road and almost immediately found Cloudside. It's in a perfect locale for wandering Nelson, with a couple of minutes walk to Baker Street, the historic heart of the city and main shopping\u002Frestaurant area. My only tiny caveat would be that the bed in our room, although mostly firm and comfortable, would shake a bit every time one of us turned over, which meant being occasionally woken up. This is probably just because we're used to a futon, many people don't mind a springier or foam topped bed. All in all a great stay.

In the end I chose 3, so that people become aware of an opinion that does not quite join the chorus of almost unanimous praise. However, I would like to point out that the Cloudside Inn is a good B&B and its owners are very friendly. But there are some points that you should be aware of when booking your stay there.\n1) For our idea of a B&B it is way too large and professional. As its name says it\u00B4s more of an inn than a B&B. The place can at least accommodate 16 people, which can create some sort of hostel-atmosphere. Upon arrival you get asked for your credit card details and have to sign the bill. Chris says this makes it easier for him and for the guests when they leave. I only know this procedure from large hotels and found it quite strange and not very \""cozy-B&B\""-like.\n2) At least the Fir-room is tiny and has a window with frosted glass only. We\u00B4ve never had such a small room before (even in a downtown Madrid hostel). The advantage is it has a an ensuite bathroom and an air-condition. From what we guessed from the infromation provided not every room has an air-condition. If this is correct, make sure you get an air-conditioned room in the summer. The weather in Nelson can get really warm. After all you might want to book one of the larger rooms even if this means no en-suite bathroom. \n3) The breakfast is good but still has to go a way before it can compete with some of the really great breakfasts a lot of B&Bs on our trip offered. As I\u00B4ve said before, the atmosphere at the breakfast table can get quite busy.\nAll in all, the house is nice and nicely situated in the city center. And as you can see from the other reviews it is highly popular. However, we think it\u00B4s not a B&B but something between hostel and small hotel. We also found it a bit over-priced (considering our small room). We wouldn\u00B4t stay there again, but we don\u00B4t know what the other places in Nelson are like.

Having said that, they are well travelled kids, but we've usually been staying in upmarket hotels as opposed to family run accommodation.\n\nFrom the first telephone call to extend our stay, I knew we had made a good decision for accommdations in Nelson.  Chris and Sally have 2 children of their own so they were very welcoming.  We were upstairs on the top floor in the Tamarack Apartment, which has 2 separate bedrooms and full kitchen cooking facilities.  It also has its own bathroom.  It was excellent for our needs, with its own private entrance off the back.  The main bedrooms which we saw were very lovely and definitely fancier than the apartment, but obviously more space constrained than what we had.  Some of the bedroom units were obviously more recently redone at an exceptionally high standard.\n\nThe location is superb, just a block or so off of the main shopping street.  We were able to walk down to the beach easily enough, as well.  The apartment has a lovely view of the townsite and mountains and lake.\n\nBoth our children loved the breakfasts, whether we were eating with an older retired couple or with another family with two (even younger) children.  The food was fresh and delicious and the menu varied on each of the 3 breakfasts which we had.\n\nChris and the 2 Sallys were all very helpful with suggestions for dinners, driving trips around the area (Chris was spot on right down to the timing to return via ferry on a long drive taking in Salmo, Creston, East Shore of Kootenay Lake, and back via Ferry), and local highlights.  \n\nWe had 3 dinners out:  1st was at All Seasons which would compete favourably with any of the 4+ star restaurants in Vancouver or any other large Canadian city.  It was a very memorable dinner, and even our daughters rated it as one of their favourite meals of all time!  2nd was at Max & Irmas which is a lovely little Italian Pizza\u002FPasta place, about 1\u002F3rd the cost of the first night but a fabulous family place for a quick bite.  3rd night was Fusion which was pretty good, but not at the standard of All Seasons.  If you had to choose, it would be hands down All Seasons.  \n\nOverall, we had a fabulous experience in Nelson, it was the highlight of our trip around the Okanagan and Kootenays and will definitely come back soon.

We chose the very non historic Prestige Lakeside. It looks more motel-like, has free parking, is lakefront and has a good restaurant and lounge with water view patio. The restaurant is a steakhouse at night.. Our room, on the Prestige level, was pricy but had a west facing balcony overlooking the marina, lake and mountains. The room came with a full breakfast which pretty much offset the premium price. The room is remodelled with crown mouldings, marble floors, 42\u201D plasma (100 channels?) CD player, alarm clock, couch and chair in a sitting area and a king-sized comfortable bed. The air-conditioned room had a mini-fridge, coffee pot, no safe and free wireless internet. The spacious bathroom had a large granite counter, marble floors, modern high-end porcelain, hairdryer, lighted make-up mirror and a flat screen TV for watching from the jetted tub. The marina has power boats, pedal-boats and canoes to rent,. They offer fishing charters from the lobby. A mall with fast food, Wal-Mart, groceries and liquor is 100 yards away. Just beyond the mall is a large park and sandy swimming beach. The town is only a few hundred yards away and there you will find the particularly good Louie\u2019s steakhouse.

This also included free breakfast for two. Thought this was a reasonable price dor what I thought was the Riverside property. Get to the hotel to check in, the one right by the lake, and find out they have two properies. The one I booked at is their other property which is actually right downtown with the train track right beside it. \n\n No way i want to stay there so check out the prices at this one. Lakeview is $320 all in cause  this place has more amenities  don't you know, and of course no train tracks. A little too much in my books for a room in Nelson BC. I can book a room in Manhatten for that price. \n\nTook a two queen montainview room at $205 plus about another $40 in taxes. This after they applied a 20% discount because I was still pretty annoyed about what looks a lot likely  a bait and switch (lakeview property versus Lakeside property, in the same friggin town?  Really?) and I really wasn't  happy that they want a cancellation fee if I don't stay at all. \n\nMountainview my butt, all you can see out the window of the second floor is the parking lot and a highways yard. If you look WAY up over all the houses you can see trees on a hill.  On top of that there is no breakfast included. \n\nYoung guy at the counter checking me in was actually pretty helpful and was doing everything he could to help out but they need to train these folks to call their guest Mr or Mrs. We are not on a first name basis.  Place also has no valet parking, doorman or baggage staff. If you are trying to run an upscale hotel then you better start getting these types of things figured out.\n\nRoom was large, well appointed and in excellent condition but no better than most Hilton properties or even the Western Budget chain in Alberta. In fact the Best Western in Revelstoke has rooms done up every bit as nice as these. This is definitely not the San Francisco downtown Marriott or a Fairmont property. \n\nThere are quite a few local choices that are more than adequte for a lot less money. This isn't  Balli, Paris, or London or even the strip in Miami. I have stayed in all of these locations recently and not paid any more for a very nice room than I paid here. Hotels in this area are simply not worth this kind of rate. If it hadn't  been for the large cancellation penalty I would  have never stayed here.

We had some great walks checking out this amazingly beautiful historic city!  \n\nUpon arrival, the staff at the hotel gave my daughter a gift from their 'treasure' box and she was thrilled!!  When we got to our lakeside room on the prestige level - we immediately loved it!  It has a balcony overlooking the marina with beautiful chairs to sit and relax.....it was private, quiet, modern and very clean!  Exactly what we wanted.  My husband loved the TV in the bathroom too!  The staff even took the time to leave a beautiful giftwrapped selection of treats and a lovely handwritten card for us....The Lindt chocolate and Pellegrino etc was enjoyed by all...\nWe went swimming in the indoor pool everyday and enjoyed the hot tub too!  The staff at the front desk were always so attentive - the first day when they noticed us walking to the pool they asked our daughter if she wanted to select some blow up  toys to take along - so into the treasure box she happily went....\n\nI had another hotel in mind, recently renovated from what I understand - and located right downtown, literally 6-7 min walk from the prestige.  We walked through it...checked it out.  I knew immediately that we sooo made the right choice with the Prestige.  We will return for sure! \n\nLastly, we must mention, we ate at the hotel restaurant most of the time because we loved the food and the service!  On the Sat night we did stumble across the Sage Wine Bar and had an early dinner of tapas and drinks - sat out on their back patio and had an amazing time!!  The food\u002Fdrinks\u002Fservice impeccable!  Totally recommend it!\n\nWe really enjoyed the West Coast Grill restaurant in the hotel too!

Exhausted, we opted for the latter and decided to sit up at the bar.  The server's name was Jessica and she was extremely friendly and helpful!  We chatted and had a nice conversation.   While sitting there my husband overheard one of the managers exclaim they were full for reservations (it was Canada Day).  3 weeks prior, I booked our stay at the Prestige to celebrate our wedding anniversary, with a check-in July 1st and checkout July 2nd.  We chose the romance package which included a $50 GC to the restaurant and we were looking forward to eating on the patio and enjoying the view.  (We were familiar with the hotel from previous stays)  So needless to say, we were immediately disappointed and further deflated \u2026 I waved Jessica over and explained our situation - she was so empathetic and tried to assure us that if we arrived before 6pm, we should be able to be seated inside.  She offered to take our name and number (because our room still wasn't ready...) to see if she could help.  The front desk associate arrived shortly thereafter to inform us we could check in.   As I waited during check in, I explained our additional dilemma and suggested that in the future, they may want to offer a reservation be made in the restaurant for guests that choose the romance package including the restaurant GC, as an added consideration\u2026She thought that was splendid idea!   Then, as she was looking at the computer screen, ready to check us in, a smile came upon her face as she looked at me and said, \""How would you like an upgrade?\""  As I stood there thinking to myself, \""wow, we are returning guests, we had to pay for our drinks in the lounge waiting for our room and we now have to sit inside because we didn't know to make a reservation...\"" and then she spoke those words.  I was immediately re-invigorated and expressed \""why, what did you have in mind?\""  She offered a lake view room, to which I exclaimed, \""YES! We would love a lake front room!\""  It was wonderful and a HUGE THANK YOU to her (unfortunately, I cannot recall her name) We went to our room, unpacked and relaxed on our balcony for about 20 minutes and then rushed to get ready hoping to be seated in the restaurant. As we entered, the host immediately recognized our names and welcomed us as he led us to our table, front and center, on the patio with the umbrella up and our menu displayed graciously for our viewing.   Confused but pleasantly surprised, we sat, ordered and indulged in a delectable meal which included an 'on the house, cheesecake in a jar' dessert for us to share.  It was perfect!  (Jessica came up and quickly explained that the couple that originally reserved the table, arrived just before us and decided to sit inside...what good fortune!) The combination of the power of positivity coupled with the sincerely capable and considerate efforts of ALL your staff made our stay truly memorable! I have shared this story numerous times and will continue to share it.   Please feel free to do the same with your associates and pass along our sincere thanks and gratitude... especially to Jessica because I\u2019m certain she worked some magic for us!

Breakfast is not included. I imagine this hotel caters to small groups, that's the feeling you get. Quaint and charming it is not, but if you like a more modern, somewhat plastic ambiance with strange decor, this is a must. I say 'strange' decor because the larger rooms seem to have themes which I do not feel are well done. The location is on the water, but it's not in a nice area.

Nelson_data\ca\181780\186051\421623374.html,Prestige Lakeside Resort &amp; Convention Centre,"""Nelson, BC is an important Heritage city that lies along the west side of Lake Kootenay, in the Selkirk Mountains, halfway between Vancouver and Calgary. It deserves a separate review, which I will presently prepare.\nNow, however, I like to tell you about the Prestige Lakeside Resort where my wife and I stayed during our recent visit to Nelson.  The resort is one of many, owned by the Huber family.  Josef Huber Sr. came to Canada in 1950 and initially settled with his family in Penticton where he bought a small Motel.  This was followed by several motels and hotels carrying the name \u201CPrestige Resort\u201D.   By 2001, along with his son Joe Huber Jr., they have turned the business into a chain of upscale hotels and resorts across BC.  Among these hotels is the Prestige Lakeside Resort in Nelson. \nWe arrived at the resort late in the afternoon, after a reasonably long drive from Kelowna.  The winding road is not very busy but is not easy to drive and you may want to give yourself enough time to arrive in day light.   The resort is right on the lake with rooms facing the lake and others facing the road.  I would recommend that you aim to get a lake view room; these, naturally, have a much better view and, it seems, better furniture as well [we did inspect these rooms, but unfortunately none were available].  The rooms facing the road and a railway track are not nearly as pleasant.   At the reception, the friendly and efficient staff helped us check in and offered useful information about the resort and the city.  \nOur attempt for a nice afternoon walk was spoiled by a cold afternoon rain.  It turned out we chose a couple of cold rainy days.  Soon after we left it was sunny again and 30 degrees.   However, we were compensated for the weather by walking tours of the city, the water front walk and nice dinners at the restaurant in the resort, which I recommend trying.  It is not inexpensive but is quite good.  We also, very much, enjoyed our breakfast on the terrace overlooking the lake.  I recommend having a slightly late breakfast, in order to enjoy the sun.  This is because the valley between the mountains at Nelson is quite narrow; it takes longer for the sun to appear above the eastern mountain and it quickly disappears behind the western mountain in the afternoon.\nOne of the pleasures of the resort is the long and well kept promenade [the waterfront pathway].  It is ideal for a morning run and for a walk during the day. You reach the promenade from the resort\u2019s lobby. You may start to the left along the lake and walk by the airport field [this is a designated dog walking path, but the dogs are friendly and they don\u2019t mind runners]. You could also turn right  and walk all the way, to and through, the Nelson city park until the Nelson bridge [the Orange Bridge on Highway 3A].  The park is very pleasant. You will be also able to see how the city is trying to deal with the Canada Geese, that occupied the park, using such modern technologies as drones, which the Geese quickly get used to and ignore.\nOur stay at the resort was quite pleasant.  I would recommend it to you.  Just make sure it is going to be sunny and warm.  And although we did not get the opportunity to do it, I can also recommend relaxing on your balcony or patio overlooking the lake. \nI will tell you about the city of Nelson in my next review.\nHave a great time at the Prestige Resort.",4,positive,"September 23, 2016",701 Lakeside Dr,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 6G3

I asked a second time for them the pay for replacement of the item, and included a very detailed list of reasons why I believed that they had failed to exercise reasonable care of my item, and why placing an item of such expense in regular mail was definitely not reasonable care in shipping, and could not even be tracked.

If you are looking for a boutique upscale experience close to the city center and all of its restaurants, shops and tourist attractions, (skating rink, public pool) then this is the hotel for you! \n\nFrom the minute you walk in, you are welcomed with several grand chandeliers and a large fireplace. The extremely friendly staff will take care of you and get you situated in your room.\n\nRooms are deluxe and modern, most with two queen beds and a large bathroom. There was a microwave, mini bar, and two desk areas in the room. We had a marvelous view of the city of Nelson and its skyline. You will find the bathroom amenities upgraded with local and natural shampoos and conditioners.\n\nInside the resort, there are four places to get food: a local pizza delivery (Thor's), room service, an upscale restaurant in the lobby with a terrace overlooking the lake, and a bistro in the lobby perfect for getting coffee in the morning. There are paths around the lake perfect for a stroll or workout, and there is a Budget car rental kiosk downstairs. A pool with hot tub is steps from the lobby, and so is a well-stocked fitness center and a large conference center. Also steps from the lobby is a moorage for yachts and local boats. All of this with incredible views of the lake and its skyline. The resort is also 900 feet approximately from a local shopping center with Walmart and SaveOnFoods.\n\nIf you ever need a boutique place to stay in Nelson, forget the Hume and stay here!

No outside drinks allowed at all in the meeting room we paid for that didn't have a bar in it.  Pizzas were paper thin, kids got bored quick so our hour stay turned into 20 minutes.  You have a group staying booking 15 rooms and you can't waive charging for the meeting room?  Competitors in the area are more receptive to groups.  \n\nWithout hockey tournaments most weekends the hotels and restaurants would suffer.  Maybe be a bit more accommodating.\n\nPool had issues with chlorine level, few kids had rashes and itchy skin.  Hot Tub was too hot one night then colder then the pool on the final night.

Apparently, asking for a straw for your drink can start a world war crises in a bar the closer you get to the west coast.  People tend not to mind their own business about it, they act all hurt, and because people have nothing else to do in their life, they take it upon themselves to save the world by eliminating straws which was a movement started by a 9 year old kid 8 years ago using bad numbers and had nothing to do about a stupid sea turtle choking on a straw off some stupid island out in the Pacific with a population of 500 people.  \n\nIf you are traveling from mid-America\u002FCanada and are making your way west, just keep in mind that the salt in the air destroys brain cells, and you start running into those people who are absolute idiots starting around Nelson who tell you that you are a bad person because you want a straw with your Crown and Coke.  I asked for ice too, hope I didn't accidently kill a polar bear by doing that.  \n\nI'm from mid-America, former military, work in Oil, and generally mind my own business.

This was going on right under my window.This level of disturbance, along with an outdoor lamp that was shining directly in my face all night,made for a sleepless night and a grumpy person in me.It just seems that some people have no sense of awareness for other guests.This is a lovely old building and it is a house, and B+B...not a hotel.The next hurdle in my desire to LOVE staying here was the incessant noise of the pool vacuum during the day. Sheesh..this was more disturbing than my life in the city.The pool had to be perfectly debris free apparently in anticipation of  weddings being hosted in the next days. More fuel for my grumpiness.I had a chat with \""the pool man\"" who turned out to be the owner of the property. The wonderfully graceful and solution focused Louise helped sort  things out for me.Bit by bit, I jollied up with my needs for quiet and a good sleep being met. I ended up absolutely loving everything about this place and asked if I could be accommodated an extra day.I had the whole pool to myself . Louise's breakfasts were delicious...homemade granola and coffee was in the dining room available for late sleepers.I don't know how Louise and Dan manage all of the details of the needs of the variety of guests...noisy families with children who have not been taught to close doors quietly,singles and childless couples wanting solitude , and hosting weddings all at the same time.They are truly gifted and delightful managers and hosts.

At a venerable eighty years of age, the original 35 room estate home of Selwyn Blaylock, past president of the Consolidated Mining Company of Trail now hosts guests from all over the world who come here for a truly unique experience. You are invited to kick off your footwear when you enter. Really? Yes, you can pad barefoot on deep pile carpets and over exquisite wooden floors as your imagination seats you at a dinner for ten in the dining room, or takes you back through time in the history room, or invites you to read the paper in the drawing room, or relax with a soothing massage lying under those strange flat black stones in the sun room, or admire the crystal chandelier as you make you way upstairs to your bedroom. \nThe sun has set by the time you check in and the deep shadows that creep down from the surrounding mountains mean you have to wait until tomorrow to explore the mansion and grounds. \nBreakfast is served with a call from the kitchen where Louise has been busy whipping up a surprisingly delicious assortment of fruits, yogurts, egg-like treats, toast and coffee.

We booked almost 2 months in advance and at booking we called to see if they were pet friendly as our dog is a huge part of our little family. As the owners had just purchased the property they didn't see an issue with it and said it would be fine as they love golden retrievers. This was not the case when we arrived. When we checked in Mark informed us that he switched our room to better accommodate us having our dog. We did appreciate that as it was closer to an exit, however, we originally booked a garden view room with a private bathroom so that it would be quieter as these rooms are at the back of the house instead of facing the main roadway. Instead we were put into a mountain view room which really only had a view of the roof and the washroom had an adjoining door into the room beside us which was a little off putting. As Mark was giving us a run down of the place he felt more like a drill sergeant than a host and he never offered us a full tour which is what every other guest gets when they arrive. When we asked where our four legged friend should do his business he said anywhere is fine as long as it's cleaned up. Not even 10 minutes later he approaches me to state how embarrassed he was that other guests may have seen him poop as he did his business in an open grassy area about 20 feet the house. I apologized and he informed me where we could take him which was more than 150 feet away from where we exited the building. I'm sorry, but if a dog has to go, he's going to go where he pleases. About 15 minutes later I met Michelle, which was the breaking point for our stay. When she first met me she assumed we were the guests with the dog as we were using the side entrance. As soon as it was confirmed that we had our dog she was immediately cold and condescending. She couldn't even take her sunglasses off to look me in the eyes when we were talking! She told us we were not allowed to leave him in the room unattended even though he is kenneled, quiet and well behaved, and we couldn't bring him into the rest of the mansion so we would have basically been confined to our small, smelly and stuffy room. When I asked her what we are supposed to do when we want to go out for dinner or to the nearby hot springs she said we would have to take him with us and leave him in the car with the windows down. I'm sorry but what!? I was absolutely dumb founded at this comment and surprised she would even think that's okay, especially after her saying she has her own dog, you think she would know better! That was the point where I felt we were very unwelcome so I immediately explained all of this to my fianc\u00E9 and that's when we decided that it was not going to work. The only positive part about this stay was that Mark did not charge us anything for leaving only an hour after we got there. The grounds are beautiful but nothing special, we will not be back. We ended up renting a suite about 10 minutes down the road which was cheaper, offered more amenities and was much more welcoming.

Perhaps I was at that particular moment, but I didn't mean to be. I was well dressed, had money burning a hole in my pocket, and was driving a clean, late-model luxury SUV, not that any of this should make a difference.

The water features are quite lovely and when you take the time to read some of the information regarding their engineering and the history of the place it is simply fascinating. Both times we chose the presidential suite and while it was brutally hot in nelson on our weekend visit leaving open the windows and popping a small fan up was comfortable and we were not bothered by sounds. If you choose a historic home, some features are going to differ from a new hotel, i.e. air conditioning but this shouldn't come as a surprise and was easily remedied. In the two years between stays the hosts have made a few changes the only one we personally struggled with a small bit was the removal of television. I understand the experience of a retreat and it wasn't a huge issue but we did miss that bit of morning news. We would also have enjoyed a small coffee machine to accommodate our crazy early morning schedules but later realized there was indeed a french press in the kitchen we could have utilized. All in all, the place is breathtaking.  The hosts were gracious and welcoming, the pool was lovely and refreshing. Breakfasts were delicious! Most things can easily be remedied over looked. I would happily recommend a visit, in fact, we have four friends headed that way as soon as they can solidify reservations!

Not professional stuff. They were very friendly. There were also stairs to get to the elevators so not handicap friendly.  Bathroom had not been renovated since the 1980s .  Beds were comfortable.  Air conditioning  did not do much and was soooooo noisy.  Train plowed throughout at 6 am sounding loud horn twice.  Woke everyone up and shook the room.  \n\nSo any way we arrive and the guy takes an impression of my credit card.  My 11 year old didn't even know what he was doing  and asked why he didn't swipe it.  This is a top notch chain?? We head to the room for a  nap and a few minutes later are woken up by a phone call from the front desk.

Ew. \n\nWhen we went to check out ( at checkout time). There is a note at the front desk that there is no one there and to use the phone to call someone.

If you arrive at night you could be in Vermont!\n\nUpon checking in the front desk is almost just that...a desk. If you are expecting the usual hotel atmosphere, you won't get it. One person behind a desk, split level but as I said the inn is very quaint.\n\nThere is no food service but there is a 7-11 a short walk and they will give you a coupon for breakfast at their other property located not too far away.\n\nNow the food offered at the other location is excellent and will be reviewed on another post but definitely have the eggs benny!\n\nOne more thing, one more important thing...upon check in the front desk agent was very polite and accommodating while she explained the room keys and internet as well as the breakfast coupon and then she finished with.....\""...and there is a train. It only comes once between midnight and 6am, but there is a train\"".\n\nAnd a train there is. Even if you know it's coming it can still make you stand up in bed as you hear the horn sound several times. The tracks are only 20 feet from the back of the hotel. But in the end if you are able to fall back asleep, the view is worth it. And the train is not the hotels fault and no hotel would ever advertise that either. \n\nSo all in all the price is right for this type of hotel or inn as they say. Not fancy but not budget either. I paid less than $100 which is right on par for this type of accommodations. Although if you have room in your budget I would suggest the Prestige on the lake.",3,negative,"October 21, 2015",1301 Front St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4C5

Before even booking this hotel no one had mentioned that there was a train 5 feet from our window. Nor did we even know nelson had a train! But when i spoke to the manager after just two nights regarding this awful train that makes you jump out of bed she had said that they tell all of their customers of the train. I do not believe this or they would have no business at all. I asked if there was anything she could do for us and that we NEVER get away (not that this was a vacation for us  as it was a very emotinal time) she said there was nothing she could do and that if we wanted to check out she wouldn't charge us. I asked if there was a way to send us to the other Prestige hotel where the train isnt right next to the window. She said there would be extra cost for us and i said i would not be paying another cent. She then called the other hotel to see if there was any rooms. she called me back and said it was full and there wasn't room for us.I then called myself and there was plenty rooms to stay in and we went to the other prestige for breakfast and dinner every night and there wasn't a soul in the resturant in the middle of october. I thought this was very bad customer service. I would not recommend this hotel as a place to stay if you plan on relaxing a little bit. The train came everynight morning between 2 am-530 am. The maids did an awful job cleaning our rooms. I had to actually ask them to change the sheets the last night we were there as the only thing that was sever changed was the towels.

I would also like to mention that their front desk staff are not very knowledgeable about their establishment. Their restaurant was very unsatisfactory and they list gluten free menu items but the majority of their items are not gluten free because of cross contamination. The one item that was truly gluten free was a salad which turned out to  very disappointing and I couldn't even finish it. The only reason we stayed at this hotel was because of the prestige name, we had stayed at the prestige in Cranbrook several times and loved it.

We chose this one over the sister Lakeside Prestige since it was less expensive. The room was fine. It was clean, well appointed, but on the smallish side for a Prestige hotel. Pillows were not comfortable though- way too fat and lumpy. I bought new inexpensive ones down the street at Walmart for the rest of our stay. The bed was very  comfortable. We got a $10 meal voucher for the Lakeside Prestige by agreeing to waive cleaning for one day. That was appreciated.\n\nWe were warned at the front desk that the train would pass by twice a day blowing its horn, which it did. The hotel is very long and narrow- it used to be a motel- and the tracks are immediately next to the edge of the back parking lot. It is built on a hill (as is most of Nelson) so the parking is VERY limited. If you are a light sleeper you will be fine as long as you are an early riser. Train went by about 7 am.\n\nAs for pet friendly... that is a stretch. We had to sign a two-page agreement indicating that if the pet caused a problem there would be a charge, they had the right to call the SPCA, pets were not to be in public areas (e.g. lobby), food and water to be only in the bathroom, pet to be crated... Not a good start. Many pet friendly hotels provide a small dog treat, an indication of dog-friendly walks, doggie daycare, poop bags, where the garbage is etc. and make pets feel welcome, not just tolerated. None of that was provided. Down the hill at the Lakeside Prestige there were leashed dogs in the lobby and staff happily told us that our dog could be tied at the railing outside the patio while we ate on the patio. It was 30 degrees outside and without being able to leave our dog in the room, and certainly not the car, we had to take her with us (which we like to do, but which is challenging when pets are not allowed outside). I spoke to the Lakeside Prestige and they called our hotel to ask if our dog could stay in the room during the event we were attending. Our hotel agreed. In fairness, they have had skiers leave dogs all day unattended, but I hope that good owners could find a compromise.\n\nOn the plus side, the facilities at the Lakeside Prestige are a 5-10 minute walk down the hill (and back up!) and are available to guests at this sister hotel. There were no facilities (pool etc.) or meal service at our hotel. The food and service at the Lakeside were excellent.",3,negative,"September 23, 2017",1301 Front St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4C5

The bed was a little on the soft side but was comfortable enough, and had a good supply of pillows. The lighting was passable (but why do Canadian hotels not have ceiling lights?!).

As soon as I\nwalked into the lobby I knew it was old.  The decor was\n1980-ish.  We checked in and did the normal authorization\nwith my credit card.  I entered my pin number for my credit\ncard and was about to put my card away, like everywhere I\nI had stayed, the front desk clerk asked for my card back\nso she can make a hard copy of my card for a damage deposit.\nI became concerned and asked why and she gave me the excuse\nthat all the hotels in Nelson were doing this.  I felt\ninsulted, assuming that we would damage our room.  I became\nfurious when I learned that my in-laws, who checked in just\nmoments before us, and were staying next door to us, were\nnot asked for a damage deposit.  I realized they asked us for\na damage deposit because I have two children, one\nsix and one eight.  Just because we have children, they\nassumed that they will damage the room.  This is no less\nthan profiling.  The management of this hotel is bended on\ncondemning children.\n\nI understand lots of people do profiling but to profile\nyoung children was offensive.\n\nIf they had a problem with children in their past, then that's\ntheir problem not mine.  And to make some lame excuse to cover\ntheir profiling behaviour shows this management, in other\ncircumstance, would be labelled racists.\n\nAs I walked to my room, I realized this place reeked of cheapness.\nThe room key was ancient, it had written on it your room number\nand the hotel address.  So don't loose your key otherwise burglers\nwould be rumaging your room for goodies.\n\nI gave the room some examination, since there was a damage deposit\non it.  I saw the night table was badly scratched, there were\ndents in the wall, there was a hole in bathroom where the sink\npiping use to be, and a print of an iron on the carpet.  The\nfixtures were of an ugly blue, except the toilet was white.\nThe toilet was not clean.\n\nI reported the night table and iron print on the carpet to the\nfront desk.

The clerk was\namused and surprised that I was asked for a damage deposit at my\nhotel when I checked-in with a credit card.  So obviously,\n\""everyone was taking damage deposit\"" in the Nelson area was a lie.\n\nIn addition, the hot tub, which advertised as part of the hotel\nwas conveniently under renovation so our room rate was devalued\nsince we never got to use it.\n\nSo if you have children I would not recommend that you stay here.\nThis place would be good for seniors and people who have no\nchildren.\n\nAnd luckily, it was the start of our vacation not the end.

The only room left was a family suite with two beds, fridge, stove and microwave.  We were shocked to see the state of the room because the countertop was broken off and there was no tape or anything to warn you to avoid it.  Children would definitely hurt themselves on this.  Someone previous had punched a hole in the wall which had not been repaired.  When we mentioned this to the hotel manager, he said that he knew about it. The family suite was very warn-out and tired and thread-bare.  If there had been another room on the main floor we would have moved our seniors but they were tired and didn't want to cause a problem.  The other room we had was on the third floor and it was much cleaner and a little more modern, although the toilets and tubs are blue like from 1960.  Due to the old plumbing, the toilet is very loud.  This room had a good view of the river and a small balcony.  Being on the north shore, you have to cross the bridge going out of town.  Another review wrote that this was a home away from home.

They really do have great beds with really nice duvets.  Our room smelled super.  Nice LCD TV on the wall.  Room was clean and in good repair.  Bathroom was dated, but also clean.  And fridge and microwave.  Room is smallish but very usable and well laid out.  Our room did have a window for some light.  But no view, as such.  It was cool in Nelson (November), so I can't comment on the AC.  And right downtown on Baker St.  Front desk staff was very nice\\helpful.  As another review called it - \""good basic accommodations\"".\nNow the down side.  They seem to have an issue with power outlets cause many things are unplugged or no outlest are available.  Upon our arrival in the room, one of the bed lights was unplugged.  To plug in the charger for my laptop I had to unplug the Microwave.  Additionally, I noticed the emergency lighting in the stairwell leading from the lobby\\reception to the second floor was unplugged.  I'm no fire marshall, but I don't think that's the way it's supposed to be.  They don't have wireless and will supply you with a network cable if you wish to have Internet access.  But the cable we got had the tabs broke off on both ends and so the cable tended to fall out of either the wall or my laptop.  Parking can be a pain.  As I understand it, they have no reserved parking.  You have to park on Baker St. which is metered parking (.50 cents and hour I think).  We arrived on Friday afternoon around 3 and at that time, getting a spot in front was a royal pain.  They do have two unloading spots you can stop in temporarily.  If you supply the front desk with quarters, they'll plug the meter for you.  A management response to another review seemed to suggest that potential guests are fully informed of the parking arrangements.  We were not.\nFinally, the reason that we couldn't recommend the Mountain Hound.  Around 130 am the couple next door to us returned to their room.  They turned on the radio fairly loud and the proceeded to have \""fun\"" for at least the next 45 minutes.  I assume the radio was meant to cover up the sounds of their fun.  It didn't.  Honestly, it was like they were right in our room with us.  Our sleep was definitely impacted.  For us, we could live with the minor inconveiences I note above.  However, we want a good nights sleep and for us this experience would not allow us to stay there again.\nAll in all, the folks at the Mountain Hound really try hard and I believe their heart is in the right place, if you will.  And their rates are very competitive.  As my TELUS buddies say, they have a good value proposition.

This one is exceptionally well restored and is a good value in price.\n\nThe restaurant and bar \u002Flounge areas that occupy the ground floor are particularly ornate restorations, with beautiful woodwork, tapestries, and antiques.  Breakfast is included in the room rate, is served at individual tables in the restaurant, and includes a choice of several hot breakfast meals that are not particularly unusual, but are prepared to order and are entirely ample.  The staff is friendly and accomodating.\n\nThe rooms are less ornate, but are very clean, furnished with attractive antique furniture in good condition and attractive wall hangings, and have clean, modern bathrooms. \n\nI have only two reservations.  One is that the parking lot owned by the hotel, which is adjacent to it and offers free parking for guests, is much too small.  Most guests must either park on the street for free at night and move by 9 AM, or park in a municipally owned garage nearby for a modest fee.\n\nThe other is that the rooms are not air conditioned (although the common areas on the ground floor are).  We were initially assigned a room above \""Mike's Pub,\"" which is an apparently popular bar on the ground level.  It was closed on the Sunday and Monday nights that we stayed there, but (unlike the more sedate lounge that was open) could probably be noisy and make sleeping difficult with windows open.  Just looking in to it, however, it appeared to be a fairly upscale place, and not a honkytonk.\n\nThe room that we were given instead faced west, overlooking the parking lot, and became uncomfortably hot from the afternoon sun.  A fan on a floor stand was provided, which we directed out the window to provide some air exchange.  The problem then was that the incoming air was from above the exhaust of the kitchen, with the result that the room filled with cooking odors (particularly of steak, which was not entirely bad but a bit too strong to be enjoyable).  Having to keep the windows open to keep the room reasonably cool also admitted noise from the street and parking lot (which held several motorcycles owned by guests whose egos apparently required making loud noise).\n\nIn conclusion, it is a great old hotel with a lot of genuine character, and deserves the patronage of people who appreciate such things, but it would be best to stay there on other than hot days in summer.

Walking up the front stairs, you know immediately that you are about to experience a stay unlike any other. The smell of the wood, the creak of the floors. The elevator which is as good as any thrill ride in BC.  Once in your room the steam heaters, porcelain and brass lamps, vintage beds and bedding put an odd smile on your face. \n\nThe staff is a major part of what makes The Hume our home away from home. Friendly faces, remind you that you are in the right place. Need to know anything about the Hotel, or the surrounding area.. Just ask. \n\nThe Hume boasts a great family restraunt, a dining lounge w\u002F 1900's era fireplaces, a dedicated pub and a seperate night club in the basement of the Hotel.

You'll find that once you are at the Hume, you can have an \""evening on the town\"" without ever having to leave the Hotel! \n\nWith world class performers at the downstairs night club called \""Spirit Bar\"" you can dance the night away with friends, or make new friends completely. The acts that Spirit Bar draws, are often acts found only in large cities - how they do it? I know.. It is too much fun, and it looks as though the entertainers love being there too! When the show is over, all it takes is a trip upstairs and you are in for the night. Should you choose to call it an early night, you may experience some noise from the show downstairs - but it'll be a friendly reminder of the fun you are missing.\n\nRyan, and the Hume staff.. Don't change a thing, don't try too hard to modernize the Hotel... It is what keeps us and many others coming back. An experience truly unlike any we have ever had.  With every year that passes we have a larger entourage join us for the unforgettable experience!

Nelson_data\ca\181780\677841\174761793.html,Hume Hotel &amp; Spa,"""First, I want to clarify that we have nothing to do with this hotel in any way, and have never met the owners. I say that because my review is so good I would consider it suspicious. :)\nWe have to travel a lot for work. 90 to 110 days a year. My wife is a Platinum level traveler. We are not spoiled or snobby types at all, but we really appreciate quality and service when we find it. We always find it at the Hume.\nThis place is exceptional. We have friends and family in Nelson, some of whom have beautiful homes who have invited us to stay for free. We can't seem to break our Hume Hotel habit. We have stayed there on 5 seperate occaisions. We were always very satisfied, but this time we were blown away. The renovation is amazing. The Hotel is centrally located so you can basically walk anywhere in town. If you have a car, you can use their parking lot or, if it is full, contact the owner of the Parkade next door. \nThe Hotel is magic in that it hides an amazing amount of rooms, restaurants and bars, in a charming footprint. \nMy wife's favorite element is \""The Library\"". It is a dark, wooodsy bar, with a timeless classic feel. The crew at the bar is fabulous. The food is modern, simple and consistently good. The drinks are perfect, and the Bar Crew seems to be there when you need them and nowhere to be found when you are leaning into a romantic moment.\nWe love the General Store Restaurant. I don't know if all rooms come with breakfast, but ours did. There are numerous places in Nelson to eat... many fabulous restaurants, and we know and enjoy them, but many times we simply can't escape the General Store Restaurant. Their food is tastey, and consistent. The menu is well priced, and surprise surprise, they are so far ahead of the curve with a great selection of Gluten Free menu items. Very cutting edge.\nWhile the food was great, a great waiter or waitress takes it to another level. We found the entire wait staff to be friendly and efficient. They were perhaps one of the main reasons we kept eating their when we should have been sampling some of Nelsons other pleasures. We enjoyed the enitire staff of the General Store, but two waitresses in particular stood out. Julie and Maya both felt like family by the time we left. On top of great service and menu recomendations, they also kept us in the loop about what was happening in the town of Nelson.  There were several treasures we might have missed, but after Julie and Maya got a feel for who we were, they would suggest things to do and places to go. We are \""morning\"" people, and they were always ready in the morning with great coffee and a vibrant smile. The breakfast specials changed daily and were creative. Kudo's to the chef!\nThe entrance to the Hume is fairly small, and the reception desk is right at the door. Sometimes when traveling, you don't want to interact outside of your family or friends. Despite being right their, the reception crew (like the library) seemed to have an uncanny knack of knowing when we wanted to be greeted, and when to pretend we were invisible, or better, when we wanted to pretend like we were walking into our own home.\nWe called from Hawaii to arrainge this trip, and weeks later, the women who we had spoken with remembered us specifically and took the time to make sure all was well.\nI hate to mention names, because there were so many excellent people working here that I am sure I will forget more then I remember. Everyone at the front desk was impeccable. I remember Miriam and Julie specifically, but there was a charming brunette and a very nice young man also working. I wish we could remember their name.\nOur favorite room is the Julliette suite. We loved it before, but the renovation was perfect. A wonderful bed and great pillows and sheets to boot. We have akways requested this room high on the corner of the hotel. Great views and very quiet. The Guest services manager asked if we had seen other suites and took us to see the ladybird Suite. A wonderful room for a family or two couples! Sorry...we have already booked it for December :)\nFor the music connoisseur, The Spirit Bar Downstairs is....EPIC. How does this bar in a small town continue to get the most amazing music. I would check online to see who is coming. They get a lot of bands that are about to be famous, and the decor\u002Fmotif of this bar is something you expect to find in Vancouver, New York or San Francisco. We were dazzled. Very edgey and trippy. It would be a killer bar even without the awesome music and DJ's. On top of the Hume there is also a sports bar... but not just any sports bar.... it is hard to explain but they nailed it.\nI left out three desciption sections. The swimming pool and fitness center were left out because they don't have them... but there is an amazing community gym, with pool, jacuzzi, sauna and fitness center a 5 minute walk down the street. Besides, Nelson is a walking town surrounded by the most amazing natural resources.\nI also left out \""Sleep Quality\"". This was to get your attention. There are a few rooms that are connected to the Spirit Bar vibrationally. At times, there can be a gentle rumbling. If you are a light sleeper, talk to the staff and they can make sure you end up in the right room. We have never had a problem, but I have heard some friends have been right above the Spirit Bar on an exceptionally boistrous music night. It is only a few of their rooms... just make sure to consider this. ( The Julliette Suite and the Ladybird Suite are always quiet).\nMy wife and I own a small restaurant on the island of Kauai, as well as a few small surfshops. Customer Service is very important to me as well as \""price to value\"" ratio. I am not worried about a cheap place as much as I am a good quality to value ratio... Hume nails it. Seriously.... so much that I had to sit down and write this review...sorry if I babbled but it is a treaure! \nWhen I first found Nelson 6 years ago, it was too good to be true, the kind of place you almost want to keep to your self, and if you do share, it is in whispers to only your closest friends and family. Well, the secret is out. Nelson is one of the jewels in the crown of British Columbia. The people, the values, the location... How can this little town be so awesome! But, to have a place like the Hume to come and stay at... a place that delivers time and time again is a mystery I can not begin to answer. I would say make your reservations far in advance because the secret is getting out. Take a moment to really let the front desk know what you need and let them help you. If you can, book direct. This helps the Hotel and also gives you a little more lattitude if you need wiggle room. I love this place. I have to stop because I am probably rambling. Put Nelson and the Hume on your bucket list. A final note to the owner or owners... in our state of Hawaii, we are constantly on the look out for amazing people to help us work our businesses. You have an amazing team. If they were in Hawaii, I would be trying to lure them away, but your staff seemed incredibly loyal and so many have worked on site for many years... that says so much about an employer! You nailed the renovation. If this place had a dry heat or steam sauna, we would probably try and retire in one of the rooms. \nAloha and Mahalo.\nKarlos and Kathy deTreaux, Kauai, Hawaii.",5,positive,"August 29, 2013",422 Vernon St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4E5

Yes, I have complaints but the pros outweigh the cons. In regards to my recent visit in September 2013 - the pros:  clean and cozy room with all the amenities; I love the hotels' great location; decent rates compared to other hotels in area; love the breakfast selection that comes with the room rate; impressed with the idea of a credit if housekeeping duties are declined on a daily basis, personable staff although I did read reviews from prior guests who did not experience the same and lastly, I really enjoy the heritage atmosphere.  The cons:  I usually stay at the Hume in off-peak times and during the week, so I'm not too disturbed by the noise from the pubs and intoxicated people but there is still noise so the price of the rooms above the pubs should definitely be far less costly; the parking situation is very frustrating:  the small free hotel parking lot is available to ALL patrons of the Hotel including liquour store customers and non-guests eating at the restaurants. I end up having to park on the street (usually a few blocks away too and can't even see my vehicle) plus feed money into the parking meter (more than one time, too as maximum time is only 2 hours) and then carry all my luggage (sometimes 2 or 3 trips) to the hotel. I personally believe the room guests should have priority over restaurant goers or liquor store customers. We are paying out more money.  There was thought that perhaps for a few dollars extra guests could park in the parkade next door  but I was told that majority of guests dismissed that idea as they didn't want to spend any more than they had to on a room. What - well, guess what?  Unless they park their vehicle in the hotel lot for their entire stay there is no extra money incurred for them but for the rest of us (the other guests) that like to explore Nelson and the surrounding area, yes we would have liked to have a convenient parking spot to go to at the end of the day.

I always go to the restaurant when I come back from my very frequent trips to Vancouver and back by Greyhound, which arrives in Nelson at 5:30 or 6:00 am. The staff are always there to greet me and the breakfasts are fast and good with pleasant efficient service. What I like most is the willingness of the staff to go the extra mile; they let me store my heavy bags while I shop for provisions before heading off to my cabin in the woods. It means a lot to me to be given those little extras which they refuse to take money for. The bars which I have gone to with friends a fair amount are also warm and inviting and inclusive with good food and atmosphere. I figure if all those things are good, the accommodations must be as well. For me, over the last 35 years, the Hume has been a very nice place to have around.

The hotel we chose  - Hume, seemed OK on the pictures, so we decided to go with it, however later we deeply regretted out choice. Here's why:\n\nThere's a club on the ground floor, and even though we were on the top fourth floor and were using ear plugs, we still could feel the vibrations coming from the club. I could only imagine how people on the lower levels felt.\n\nThere was some sort of a either duct system, or ventilation outside our suite that added this buzzing or humming noise. We like watching movies when we stay in hotels, thus this experience was partially ruined by all the noises. \n\nThe Hotel does not enforce quiet hours to the guests, there are no visible signs inside of the suite that remind you to be respectful and quiet during normal sleeping hours of 11 p. to 8 a.m. Therefore, we also were woken up throughout the night be people talking very loud in the corridor, laughing, running, and jumping. Some of that was done  a few centimeters from our door. \n\nCheckout time is at 11 a.m., however the housekeepers start knocking on the doors as early as 9 a.m. saying \""Housekeeping!\"" . We had  a \""Do not disturb sigh\"", but them knocking on the doors around our suite and yelling \""Housekeeping!\"" took away good 1.5 hours from our sleep. \n\nOverall, we were very disappointed since having a good, undisturbed sleep is a prerequisite for a good mood and feeling energized, so you can fully enjoy all the activities during the day.\n\nIf you are a party animal, then you probably wont mind staying in this hotel, otherwise find something else and make sure that place is actually quiet. \n\nOn a good side, breakfast was fine, cannot complain about that.",2,negative,"May 5, 2014",422 Vernon St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4E5

Nelson_data\ca\181780\677841\208053482.html,Hume Hotel &amp; Spa,"""I spent the better part of the 90's looking after this old gem for the most amazing owners one could hope to work for. We constantly made small improvements to all of the guest rooms and did what we could with the building at that time. Sure we had to make apologies from time to time for not having air conditioning in the guest rooms (City could not provide us enough power), and sometimes the hot water took a while to reach the fourth floor from the massive boiler located in the basement. This was the challenge of operating a century old building.\n\nIn spite of all these day to day little things, was always the incredible roster of employees that we were able to attract to handle all of these challenges. The Service the Hume Hotel continues to deliver has always been second to none in the arena of small independent boutique hotels.\n\nFor my first return to the property in several years; my wife and I were afforded the opportunity to stay in one of the newly renovated 4th floor rooms.\n\nThe old elevator that I had rode many times in the past was still operational and the ride to the 4th floor brought back a lot of memories. When the doors opened I thought I had been transported to a different hotel. Gone were the sloped floors and the decor, was well I would could consider a great new take on a Classic Heritage Property. I felt a sense of... Dave, Sheila and Ryan, you did it right! Congratulations.\n\nMy first walk around the hallways was in awe. The subtle items that could not be changed; have not, and have always added to the charm of the property. This is no different if you're in the Banff Springs or Hotel Vancouver. There are elements you cannot change, nor would you ever want to. It adds to the enjoyment of your stay. Knowing that Duane was still involved as the Building Maintenance Manager you knew everything was re-built to perfection.\n\nWe entered the new 'Juliette' suite and instantly the value of what we had paid for the room became evident. This same room would be triple the price in Vancouver or any other major city. Nice. Air Conditioning... finally. That must be a nice phrase for the Front Desk Reception team to let guests know... \""Yes, we do have Air Conditioned rooms.\""\n\nThe rest of the building is still well a City within a City. You really never have to leave this property as you can enjoy the best comfort food and beverages from any of the many venues. Looking for Quiet and cozy... Library Lounge. Great draft beer, no finer pub in the Kootenay's than Mike's Place. General Store for breakfast and Spirit Bar for late night whatever. The Hume has it all.\n\nHaving been gone for over 14 years, I felt a sense of peace that the building was even better then when I had left, and that the future of it has been in the very capable hands of General Manager Ryan Martin. Seeing some of the lifelong employees still enjoying work there was a definite bonus. MJ, Richard, Lorelei, Franzi, Ward and of course the legendary Greg Schlossher, and many others continue to add to the legendary status of this one of a kind Nelson Heritage Property.\n\nIt always comes down to Service and that feeling that you are away from home, but not too far... That's the way we like to travel.\n\nLooking forward to another visit and will plan to stay a little longer next time.\n\nCheers!\n\nCameron.",5,positive,"May 30, 2014",422 Vernon St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4E5

The entry\u002Flobby is very small and quaint with rustic wood and old-fashioned type carpeting. We were greeted by Jesse, who was so very friendly and very helpful with our bags. Check in was easy and efficient. We had heard this old hotel can be a bit noisy at times from the bars and entertainment, so we asked for a very quiet room and #477 was just that. The entire fourth floor has been remodeled and our room was just great; light and airy, has A\u002FC and large pieces of furniture. The bed was so comfortable as were the feather pillows and the bedding was high quality. Our room faced \u201Cinward\u201D so the noise from the bars and street didn\u2019t reach us. I believe this is important to know if you want a peaceful and good night\u2019s sleep! A hearty breakfast is included in the room rate. Has a Keurig coffee maker and a small refrigerator. The windows open a little for fresh air. The bathroom was light also, with the black and white tile floor, but the sink was just a pedestal type and nowhere to put our dop kits, etc. This I am sure is to keep the \u201Cold feel\u2019 of yesteryear! The shower was over the tub and good shower head. The bed is comfortable the and bedding is great, but the towels are average as are the amenities. The restaurant downstairs is supposed to be one of the best in town along with the atmosphere. It is like walking into a beautiful Victorian place with antique lamps, old world wood; a quaint and cozy place. This hotel is a very special place to eat, stay and also hold special occasions. If you don\u2019t stay here at least go in and check it out. All the employees from the front staff to the waitresses were wonderfully friendly and accommodating.

I think it is classier and has more charm.\nThe hotel is located right in the middle of downtown Nelson, so once you are checked in you can leave your room and walk to pretty well anywhere of interest in town.\n\nWhen we booked, I made a special request for a very quiet room, away from any elevators, ice machines or pop machines.  We were placed in one of the newly renovated rooms on the 4th floor.  The room was nicely appointed and well laid out.  I was interested to see that they even provided ear plugs.  More about that later.\n\nThe Library (lounge) served an excellent supper and we were entertained by a couple of fellows playing some nice, laid back jazz.  Their music was played softly, in the background, and didn't interfere with conversation like so many bands do these days.\n\nWe headed for bed at about 10pm, after a short walk about town.  The bass thumping from the sports bar started at about 10:30 and continued to get louder until, finally at 11:15pm, we phoned down to complain.  We were told that the front desk would ask that the bass be turned down.  It was, a bit, but we still needed to wear the earplugs in order to get to sleep.  The sports bar is on the 2nd floor for some strange reason.  They have room for a bar in the basement, but the one that is the problem is on the 2nd floor.  I don't know how anyone in a 3rd floor room could have good to sleep.\n\nThe breakfast was average, but it was a hot breakfast and included with the cost of the room.  That was nice, because their room costs are high.  Nevertheless, the cost is aligned with the quality of the renovated rooms and the services, that is if the sports bar wasn't there.\nHonestly, I which the owners of such places would decide whether they want to be hoteliers or an entertainment centre, because mixing them is a disaster for those clients wanting a good night's sleep.  That is what I always need when I am travelling - a good nights sleep.\n\nWe were fortunate to get a parking spot right beside the hotel in their own parking lot, but there weren't enough spaces for everyone staying in the hotel.  I'm not sure where others parked.\n\nMy conclusion:  Come for great food.  If you want a good sleep, find somewhere else to bed down.\n\nIf it wasn't for the sports bar challenge I would have rated this place 5 stars.  I should also mention that all the personnel that we dealt with were extremely pleasant and helpful.",3,negative,"May 13, 2015",422 Vernon St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4E5

There is an excellent hot or cold breakfast that is included in the rate. Friendly helpful staff and the restaurant lounge offers decent food and live jazz every night. We never had a problem finding parking in the adjacent hotel parking lot. Comfortable beds, recently renovated well appointed rooms.they offer a $5:00 green restaurant\u002Fbar credit  if you opt out of daily room cleaning. Nice incentive.\nTHE BAD NEWS ....we were there for three nights October 18 through 20. I booked a few weeks in advance and I was never told that the hotel was under construction. As we were travelling with a small dog I was told that there is only 1 pet friendly room on the top floor( odd as you would think s pet room would be on a lower floor for easy exit to the great out doors.) at any rate the room was very well appointed, didn't smell like dog as it was very clean and recently renovated. BUT..... We were NOT told about the renovation until check in ( a little late to make alternate plans) and that the crew was working below us as . They started between 8 and 9am. The swearing and hammering really got going around 9:00 and drove us out of the room. It's not  that we were going to be hanging in the room but none the less annoying. We felt like we had to get the hell out of there. Oh and on day two they called to say the water would be off for a few hours in the A.M.  So we were rushed to have our shower and get out .We were also never informed that the spa was closed due to renovation.\nWhen I called to make the renovation, we originally wanted to check in a day earlier but I was told there was only 1 pet friendly room available it it was not available on the 17th. So we rescheduled our holiday to begin on the 18th. On the night of Oct 19th we were awakened by a crying, barking dog. Hey I thought there was only 1 pet friendly room?\nHAPPY ENDING.....I spoke with the manager of guest services about not being told in advance about the renovations and the barking dog in the 2nd phantom pet room? She apologized said she would credit us 3x$20=$60.00 pet fee. She planned on telling the construction workers to cleanup the *F *BOMBS and wished us well.Obviously, she  was unaware of the construction workers going off and as well as the additional dog in the hotel.\nFair enough right?

Noise (construction+pub music+street) meant quiet hours are 2am-8am.  I understood from previous reviews and at check-in that there would be noise.  Management did not inform me that the 3rd floor is under construction and all sound proofing was removed; the bass from the pub vibrated through my suite's floor, progressively louder until pub closing. Played guess that song by the bass for a while, but not so much fun at midnight, by which time the bass and lyrics were audible. Expect the street noise from a pub, and we had it all; the gf\u002Fbf fights and tears, the fights, and the whoops and hoots of happy patrons. That's to be expected. Suite #480 is set-up with a sofa bed in the living room, but only sheer curtains on the 4 windows.  If you prefer to block the street lights at night, not possible as no blackout curtains. \n\nIt took me 3 days to figure out how this place works their customer service. They offload responsibility onto someone else; so if you have a concern follow through to a resolution with one person. After night one I spoke with reception who commiserated about the noise, but couldn't do anything until the next day when the customer service manager was on shift. After night 2 I spoke with the customer service manager who commiserated about the noise and offered to change rooms.  Declined this offer, not interested in packing up and I wanted a suite for a family vacation, not hotel rooms.  I suggested a discount. No further word from manager that day. After night three decided to leave, I needed rest. Room charge for three nights was $993.57, they gave me a discount of $66.24, 20% for one night. Spoke with the customer service manager about a 20% discount each night, she said the General Manger made the decision, and then kept saying \""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry\"".  And then tried to offload onto me by asking did I call down to the night desk about the noise. \n\nThe hotel is well-preserved, good location, brings in some excellent musicians, but I'd rather stay elsewhere, lots of other great places to stay in Nelson, and visit the pub and restaurants.

The bathroom was the nicest we've had in a hotel: beautiful tiled floor, great shower, and large. The included breakfast was a nice bonus.\nThe bad: 1) Parking is a major problem. We've never stayed at a hotel where we had to scrounge for parking. If you don't get a spot in the hotel parking lot (about 10 spaces) or the paid parkade next door (which was full), you have to park on the street. All spaces are metered until 5:00 p.m. You have to move or feed the meter at 9:00 a.m. and there's a two hour limit. There is a meter man who issues tickets, so beware.\n2) Noise: When we arrived at the front desk, the noise from the bar was so loud, we could hardly hear the clerk. Fortunately, our room was on the 3rd floor, so we didn't hear it there, but a hotel that provides earplugs is saying something about the quality of the sleep you can expect. It also tells you that their bar business is more important than your comfort. We were also plagued by a party going on in the suite next door. When the bars closed at midnight, the group moved upstairs. At 1:00 a.m. a staff member told them to quiet down and make the extra guests leave. There was no follow-up, so the noise continued until 3:30. This was the worst night's sleep we've ever had in a hotel.\nThere was a lot we liked about this hotel, particularly the heritage touches, but I'd have to think hard before I booked here again.",3,negative,"June 23, 2016",422 Vernon St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4E5

Rooms are very nice and staff are super friendly. Had a really nice time but be aware that there is a grand total of 10 free parking spots for the ENTIRE hotel, bar, pub, and restaurants. That's ridiculous honestly, there's a parking garage directly next door which will accomodate your vehicle just fine, but make sure you factor in about $10 CAD extra a day for either meters or the parking garage. I know that this hotel was built before cars were a everyday thing, and that there's no way they're able to get any more spots. But advertising 'free parking' when there's only 10 entire spaces for the entire building is pretty fraudulent. \n\nThere is also a pub, and Spirit Bar in the basement of this hotel, which is great if you're in to it, otherwise there was a bit of noise from the bar at peak hours on the weekend, even from the 4th floor were we stayed. The hotel does make note of this with your reservation though, and provides earplugs. It wasn't a big enough deal to even complain about, and we're not bar people.\n\nI've said my piece, and overall I'd recommend this hotel as being a great 'character' hotel, the restaurants are great, the pub has an awesome atmosphere, and the location is right where you want to be in Nelson.",4,positive,"June 28, 2016",422 Vernon St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4E5

We travelled west to Creston BC then north on Highway 3A ( scenic drive along the lake ) to Kootenay Bay where we caught the FREE 35 minute ferry across to Balfour and from there a short drive to Nelson. Our stay at the Hume Hotel in Nelson was for 3 nights. As others have mentioned this hotel is an older structure originally constructed in the 1890's. but has been fully renovated ( other than the General Store Restaurant on site where renos should be completed shortly ).\nRooms are clean and comfortable and include a small fridge. Our unit was on the top floor (4th). We were there during the week and we experienced no noise from the bar downstairs ( some other reviewers said on weekends when the bands play in the bar they could hear it and needed earplugs ). Breakfast which is included in the price of the room is served a la carte as opposed to buffet and there are several choices to choose from. Food was delicious. We also had 2 dinners in the Library Restaurant in the hotel and the food was excellent there as well. ALL staff at this hotel were friendly and accommodating. Yes, as others have noted parking is an issue as there are only about 10 spaces at the back of the hotel but we were fortunate to always find a spot during our stay.\nNelson is a smaller city of 10,000 people with one smaller shopping mall ( includes Walmart and Shoppers Drug Mart ) and there is a Safeway and small Co-op Store elsewhere but other stores in Nelson appear to be locally owned outlets. There is a lengthy scenic walk area along the lakeshore and an older original streetcar that you can ride for a small fee in the same area.\nWe would not hesitate to recommend the Hume hotel in Nelson and would certainly return.",5,positive,"July 6, 2016",422 Vernon St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4E5

For the last twenty years, Jill and I make the trek to shop the constantly changing stores on the main drag. We drive up from Spokane and walk the shops which change based on the exchange rate of the dollar. The tiny French bakery sells ridiculously good breads and cookies, and that fortifies our march down the main drag to buy local crafts, explore the new and old stores, eat at the always wonderful restaurants, and then come back to rest in the nicely appointed Hume.  Because it is situated only a block off the main street in Nelson you can settle in and then walk to your heart's content. The breakfast options are decent but not terribly varied.

If things go well, people at the front desk often go unnoticed. If things do not go well, or even badly, the whole stay is affected, as happened during our time at the landmark Hume Hotel in beautiful downtown Nelson. First off, checking in -- the young woman at the front desk could not have been more blas\u00E9, if not downright rude. She made us feel as if we were interrupting something more important, like sending a text message perhaps. And when she made an error with my credit card, requiring us to start the check-in process all over, she was barely apologetic at all. Not good. Even worse was what transpired with the young man who shared the front desk, perhaps the bell captain. I told him that we had a very difficult time pulling into the free hotel parking lot because of a huge monster pickup truck that was parked in the first space in from the street; he said he'd check that out. Some time later, after I had finished transporting our luggage to our room, I checked back with him and he said there was nothing he could do because the truck was occupying a handicapped space. This seemed unsatisfactory buck-passing to me. Later, remembering that I had had to provide my vehicle license plate during check-in, I went out and wrote down the plate of the offending truck and a Canadian hotel web address that was emblazoned on the truck's back window. During that process, I also provided hand signal directions to a van carrying a full load of tourists as it maneuvered very carefully and very slowly into the lot past the truck. When I returned to the front desk, I related this and also provided the license plate info for the truck which, it turned out, could have pulled forward a couple feet in its space and thereby lessened its danger to other vehicles. This added info produced no successful action by the front desk either that evening or overnight (when I often worried about my own vehicle or others being struck by some driver trying to enter the lot). The next morning, I reloaded our car and assisted another van driver inching his way out of the lot. Then a tall fellow with a slight limp got into his pickup and drove away -- more than 12 hours after I first reported the problem to the front desk. Nothing had alleviated the perilous situation in the parking lot. So never mind that our room at the Hume was quite lovely, spacious and well-appointed. Never mind that the free breakfast Saturday morning included a perfect eggs benedict. The poor response by the front desk to repeated pleas had ruined our stay.",2,negative,"October 17, 2018",422 Vernon St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4E5

When I called down I was put on hold while the receptionist looked to see if they had any available--they only have a limited number, and you have to go down and get it. Later I needed a pen and looked around...the room didn't even have a pen. Nor does it provide much in the way of bathroom amenities--there is a dispenser with shower gel and shampoo in the shower, but no conditioner or moisturizer and only one teeny bar of soap for both the bath and shower. None of these things are the end of the world but it would have been nice to know up front so we could have asked for the hair dryer and more soap when we checked in. \nAlso, the noise...we requested a room that would be the least subject to bar noise, but we were awakened at bar closing by a group screaming and destroying property in the alley that we overlooked. It went on for a LONG time-why no one at the hotel went out to stop it (it was probably patrons from their bars, and it was hotel property they were dragging into the alley and busting up!), or called the cops, is puzzling.\nIf it's your first time in Nelson I'd recommend getting info on the town before you go. We knew there were walking and driving tour maps but the tourist office was closed (on a saturday afternoon). We walked around on our own but it didn't seem very interesting--there was an airstrip, a Walmart, and lots of run down houses...the downtown was okay but there must be more (or maybe the Chamber of Commerce just does a really good job convincing you how historic and cute their town is).\n",4,positive,"September 18, 2007",422 Vernon St,Nelson,Kootenay Rockies,V1L 4E5

This was our first ever stay at an actual Vacation Rental, but the immediate impression we had was, \""home\"".  Our destination was the Silverking Suite Tucked away at the back of the building.  Entering the suite was super easy, as explained by the Proprietor, and you walk in to a cozy, and uniquely decorated suite.  The suite was immaculately clean, with high quality furniture, and original art created locally.  The Kitchen was fully stocked with everything imaginable for cooking utensils.  After a quick inventory, I had determined this kitchen could handle a full on Turkey Dinner.  Full size Fridge, Oven \u002F Range, Microwave, and Coffee Maker are right there on the counter.  Full on built-in dishwasher, and twin sinks to handle quick and easy clean up.  Nice little iPod \u002F iPhone dock for a great sound while in the kitchen.  \n\nLiving room had a Futon Couch, but incredibly high quality.  Able to set that up almost instantly, and curl up and watch a movie on the provided TV, and DVD.  More than ample lighting, and all of it tasteful, and beautiful really.  \n\nThe bedroom was cozy, but the bed was super comfortable, sitting atop a \""sleigh\"" style frame.  More than enough storage for clothing etc, and spare bedding complete with a duvet that rivalled the futon in thickness.\n\nThe bathroom ws complete, more than enough linens and suplies, but spacious and gorgeous.  The entire suite has radiant floor heat, but in here is where you feel it best.  Barefoot in the bathroom is not a problem even on the coldest day.  \n\nIn the end, this particular suite was not what we had hoped, however, we definitely made do, and enjoyed it nonetheless.  I understand one suite has a large clawfooted tub, which was what we were going for, but our own darn fault since we didn't ask. This particular suite would be highly recommended for parties up to 4, and where you would be away from the suite for most of the day.  Working professionals, winter sport enthusiasts, and other travellers would find this to be ideal.  Singles, couples and families would do just fine here.  \n\nPROS: Right at the core of town, yet tucked away for quiet and privacy. Incredible service.  Incredibly clean, and well equipped.  Warm and cozy.  Quiet and peaceful.  Beautiful and original artwork, and decor that more than makes up for the view.\n\nCONS: Parking alley is tricky for long wheel base vehicles (Vans \u002F Trucks), but street parking is just as available.  Suite could have used some humidity control.  We found it to be on the dry side.  The view.  Nelson has some incredible views, and this suite does not capture any of it.\n\nConclusion:  The cons listed are entirely superficial, as there is a handy solution to address them.  Because of its location, you are literally minutes from spectacular views, shopping, dining, and entertainment, and that is all walking.  The service was incredible, and you immediately get a strong feeling that the owner takes great pride in the property.  It truly is a home while away from home.

Nelson_data\ca\181791\1233695\179004310.html,Twin Rivers Motel &amp; RV Park,"""If you are looking for a Kitchen unit, Twin Rivers Motel is your only viable choice in Castlegar.  Highlights: (1) The kitchens in this motel are fantastic: new General Electric gas stoves, full size fridges, new vinyl or laminate flooring (it varies by unit), new cupboards, big sinks with new plumbing, tons of water pressure and plentiful hot water. The supply of utensils, plates, pots and pans was a bit spotty by unit but whatever we found lacking the helpful staff quickly produced a new from their stock room. (2) Clean with Daily Housekeeping: The units are well kept, and staff clean daily as well as bringing in new linens. They really clean too \u2026 bathroom and kitchen cleaned daily, floors vacuumed. This is a cut above most motels where they just make the bed and or change the linen. The Twin Rivers staff actually clean your suite as if new guests are arriving, a real treat, and in my experience unprecedented at this budget price. (3) The location for this motel is quite good along the main Columbia Avenue yet away from the intersections and highway connectors. While there is traffic out front, it\u2019s local, not heavy trucks and not the volume found along the highway. (4) Nice bachelor suites. One wing of the motel runs East-West and is comprised of bachelor units with uniform furnishings and updated flooring. Most of these units face the courtyard on the riverside of the property, away from the road. Short-term stay travellers will likely enjoy this location and the value of these units more than any of the chain motels in town. The river area provides a very welcome reprieve from the summer heat, and these units have a classic flat roof and beam awning that covers the walks and door ways, ideal for coming and going in snow and rain. (5) Spacious one-bedroom suites. The front, road-facing units are all spacious one-bedroom suites with full size picture windows out front. The bathrooms and bedroom are on the riverside at the back, the living room (with another queen bed), and kitchen at the front, roadside. Both the living room and bedroom have closets. It\u2019s drive up parking here to your front door. (6) Gas, individual heaters in each unit \u2013 very warm if you like. (7) Air conditioning too. (8) Pet friendly. If you are able bodied, you will find a switch back trail off the back that takes you down to the river where there is a stream, a flat meandering path in the woods, a beach, and a trail that you can take all the way to a more significant creek towards the South. A great morning outing for you and your Pet without getting into your car. What is idiosyncratic: (1) No doors on the suite bedrooms and the bathroom is as an ensuite; This is fine when all parties staying usually live in close quarters with each other but might be awkward if you were expecting more privacy between sleeping areas. (2) Every one-bedroom suite has an entirely different set of flooring and differing furniture, with a great deal of variance in age and condition between units. The manager\u2019s were super helpful in letting us see all available suites, so we selected one with brand new carpet in the living room and bedroom, and brand new, well installed laminate flooring in the kitchen, vinyl in the entry and in the bathroom, with a full tub in the bathroom. Our suite also had a sofa in the living room, which made for a nicer, more livable space. Other suites had shower stalls, some had all laminate flooring, others had older carpet that still retained the cigarette smell from the era when indoor smoking was all the rage, chairs were missing or mismatched, only the suite we took had a sofa, TVs were flat screen or the giant models before LD, mattresses were good but head boards spanned every era from the 1960 to the present. You get the picture, this is not a chain and it is updated on an as-needed basis so be sure to ask and take your pick! Some wishes: (1) The kitchens could use a set of hooks so that dish towels can hang up, and a towel bar in the bathroom near the tub would be nice. (2) The bathroom lacks a fan. We kept the window open when showering but it really needs a fan for better ventilation and to minimize humidity. (3) Reupholster the furnishings and get new bed spreads. When you are keeping a place nice and clean and have friendly, sincere staff and a good location, it is a shame to have it look run down with such minor niceties. \n\nOur hounds loved the low, wide picture window so they could sit in the living room and keep tabs on the town.",4,positive,"September 28, 2013",1485 Columbia Ave,Castlegar,Kootenay Rockies,V1N 1H8

The hotel feels old, I know the building has been there for years, but I thought that when it became a Super 8 they would have made it more modern, basically they changed the bedding and painted.  That's it.  One of the reasons we booked there was to make use of the pool area.  When we arrived, there were signs saying it was closed for maintenance.  I would have liked to have been told that when I booked the room.  We asked about it, they checked and said it was done and took the signs down, but it was frustrating.  When I checked in, I was asked for a credit card that they would charge 3x the room rate, for security reasons!  REALLY???   I have stayed at many hotels, yes, I have given a credit card number, but never charged anything until I checked out.  Then when I went to leave, they wouldn't refund my deposit until they inspected the room.  I was made to feel like a criminal.  I understand there are times when this is neccessary, I have worked in hotels myself, but we were a family, my husband and myself middle aged and clean cut.  By the time I left, I felt like trash.

It is located at the Kinnaird end of town, just off Highway 3, and near several restaurants (including many just south of the highway crossing), a grocery store and a cold wine and beer store.  The hotel is an older building dating back to the 1960s when the Keenleyside Dam was being constructed.  It was renovated a little over a decade ago, with the addition of the pool, theme rooms, and upgrading of the old pub into the Black Rooster pub and restaurant.  I have always booked a room with a kitchenette which comes with a sink, fridge, stove top, cutlery and dishes for 2, a few pots and a coffee maker.  The beds are newer and still firm and the room service is good, maintaining good standards of cleanliness and functionality.  I have however observed one or two minor problems. Because the underlying structure is older, the building creaks at night, especially if there is a floor above you and sometimes it is loud enough to wake you up.  The air conditioning also has to work hard and noisily to keep the rooms cool in the summer; a particular problem if you have a room with windows on the pool.  The breakfast is dominated by carbohydrates; this is not surprising for hotels providing an inclusive breakfast, but here there are no meats (no bacon, sausage or ham which is provided elsewhere)  and little fruit (they provide apples daily, but other fruits only once or twice a week from my experience).  That said, the coffee is good, they have waffle machines, and the reception and breakfast room staff are very helpful.  I have also had problems with their swipe key cards which regularly deprogram. I know this is becoming more common as we all carry phones, pads, tablets, remotely activated car keys and lots of other cards, all of which can deprogram a room key, but it seems a regular occurrence (as in every two days or so) at the Super 8.  I will comment that the Black Rooster next door is one of the better restaurants in Castlegar with tasty, reasonably priced specials, a reasonable selection of beers, and sports TV that isn't too noisy.

As a Super 8 it was fine and the room compared with that of a Hampton Inn, apart from the fixtures and fittings. Eg no wardrobe or closet, just a clothes rail. The fridge and microwave just stuck there on their own, but not a problem for us. \n\nAlso the large FS TV had the cable dangling down. Again not an issue but it made the room look messy.\n\nThe beds were comfortable and we had all we needed. Including china cups - hooray! And a generous supply of coffee pods and all the trimmings. Much more upmarket properties just provide measly paper cups these days.\n\nThe bathroom which was excellent apart from two cracked floor tiles which really should be replaced.\n\nThe building was odd and seemed to be designed round their feature pool (slide not available during our stay. Oh dear.). Not sure why Canadian motels see the need to have kiddies pools? Have seen them elsewhere.\n\nHotel room designers please take note: do try out the facilities you design. So many places put the toilet roll where people of our age find difficulty reaching without causing serious back injuries. This Super 8 was the first of the last 11 hotels to put the toilet roll in a sensible place. Also, print SHAMPOO in larger letters on those little bottles please.

I can appreciate the fact she was concerned for the childs saftey, but to rais her voice was uncalled for.  Also, the house keeping staff also thought it was her duty to let the 8 year old girls know that laughing and talking in the halls was frowned upon in the hotel.  I just happened to be steps behind them, and the housekeeper looked very embaressed that she was \""caught\"" been rude to the children.\n\nAnother issue I had was when I asked if we could request a late check-out.

When I questioningly apologized for the inconvenience the younger girl quickly stepped up and said, \""no no it was my fault, I'm very sorry, this is not your fault\"".   We were finally checked into a room but later that night, after 11 PM, that same woman called my room and told me that  \""they will not want you be in that room tomorrow.   Pack your bags and have them ready in the morning\"".   When I reported to the counter in the morning and told them that I had packed my bags, they thanked me and said that the cleaning staff would move my bags later in the morning  -  A fact which the rude lady at conveniently left out when she made it seem like first thing in the morning I better get out of there.

This was great since the kids tend to live at the hotel pools when we go away.  We were in town for a wedding.  Our room had two parts: 1) the kid's side had 3 beds, bunk style with ladders to each one.  The room was painted in a space theme with glow in the dark paint. 2)the adult side had a queen bed and looked like a typical hotel room with a pocket door to close off the kids room.  The room was clean and housekeeping did a decent job.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about where the good stuff ends.  I found the room very dark and since it opened to the pool, there was no natural light because the curtains needed to be kept closed for privacy reasons.  Breakfast was a mess.  The quality was low for this style. There were not enough tables, nowhere to put dirty dishes, the single cup for the waffles was disgusting.  Only one side of the toaster worked.  Milk for the cereal was very slow to be replenished.  We decided to go elsewhere for breakfast a couple of times. \n\nThen one night after a long day we returned to be told that our room had been double booked and we had to move first thing the next morning.  We had to take time out of our very busy day to pack up everything and move to accommodate the hotel's needs.\n\nAs if I needed more stuff to do!

We chose the one that appeared to be the  least dirty, at least that was what we thought. \nAt this point we should have left, but it was 11:00pm, and we had travelled 8 hours with a 3 year old to attend a funeral the next day.

This bothered me so much, I phoned down to the front desk and was told there were no other suites available as we had already seen them all.  My impression was that  if the room had been cleaned at all, it was certainly not done well enough as there were smudges on the counters and mirrors and the kitchen was greasy.  (We had no intention of using the kitchen, but we did need to use the bathroom!)  The side of the bathtub had urine stains and the toilet had fecel matter stuck to the outside of it.\n  When we checked out, we were told we would thave to wait until Monday to speak to the manager, so I reluctantly paid for the room thinking we could resolve this matter with the manager over the phone.  We had used our Entertainment Book card for a discount, and was then informed that since we got a discount we should be happy with sub-standard service.   Our disappointing and sickening stay at the Super 8 Castlegar was not so Super, and ruined our day that should have been spent comforting grieving family and friends.  \nTo add insult to our disappoinment, the manager informed us that after consulting with her staff, she was told that WE had trashed the room.

With the Safeway just across the parking lot, it made life much easier at the end of a long day at work. Also, a wonderful beer and wine shop downstairs, ( my favorite shop in all of Castlegar!) And the Black Rooster Restaurant next door is good, great staff every time I have been there.\n No oven in the kitchenette means we have to use the microwave more that we would like.  Some rooms have a fry pan, some dont, some have a sharp knife, some dont. Housekeeping is hit and miss, they come every day, but if they empty the garbage, sometimes they forget to put a new garbage bag in the can. Just little things like that sometimes. But when you have a kitchen, you need a bag in the trash.\nAir conditioners work in some rooms, but not in others. We had a king bed that was fine. There was plenty of space in the king kitchenette room. But the internet is horrible!  I felt like I was back in the days of dial-up, and you cant conduct any online business with that pathetic internet service. When you check in, they give you a code to punch in for access. The next morning, at 5am, I am down to the lobby to get a new access code?? After that, it was usually good for a day or two. I am going to be there for a couple of weeks, why cant I have a code that will last that long? Front desk staff can be good, or awful. When we stay at a hotel for the first time, we tip at the end of the stay, just to see if the staff does their job according to tips or if they just do a good job. As the days went by, our housekeeping staff showed that they are the type that works according to tips...so were tipped accordingly.\nThe key cards are awful as well, most of the time, you have to try again and again to get the door to unlock. If you get a good one...hold onto it!\nAll in all, a good enough stay.

There\u2019s plenty of ample free parking for visitors with a Safeway store across the parking lot and a separate liquor store attached to the hotel. The front desk staff are pleasant and professional.\n\nWhat we were quite disappointed in this trip was two things. While we stayed there a few nights, the daily housekeeping of our room was never done completely. Dishes we had used for warmed up meals and wine glasses were never removed, not sure why? Each day we were also shorted something - towels, Kleenex, etc. Our other disappointment was in the quality of the breakfast that was provided with our room. Besides toast or a bagel, the only other hot choice was a waffle. The remaining options beyond that were limited to a few pastries, cereal, hard boiled eggs (that seemed to be in short supply) and either an apple or an orange.

I myself find it worse to pay even more money for a hotel room where I don't get breakfast and hear people coming and going all night.\n\nIf you want to go somewhere for relaxation and to be treated like royalty, we recommend the Windborne Bed and Breakfast.  When setting up the reservation, Marc stated that he wanted to make this experience 'as stress free as possible' and they did!  Our stay was short but it hit the spot and we would definitely come back again.

The first time I stayed here was during the summer, and one of the first things you notice is the incredible landscaping. The garden is breathtaking, and you feel like you're entering a little paradise (not to mention the two adorable and very friendly dogs that roam the yard). The house is stunning, with 3 different suites to choose from, each one unique. I chose the Moonlight suite the first time I stayed there. Wow. It has it's own private balcony, huge luxury bed with beautiful decor, and the washroom is just incredible (a large jacuzzi and the best stand up shower that I've ever experienced). The location is perfect, as you are close enough to town to do any shopping or eating out you might want to do (about a 7 minute drive, tops), but also far enough out of town so you can enjoy hikes up the mountain side, or kayak rides in the river\u002Flake which is basically just outside their front door.\n\nThe second time I stayed here was in winter. What a beautiful setting for a cozy winter getaway. A fireplace upstairs, big open windows. I just curled up with a book and a blanket on the couch and relaxed.\n\nI realize this review is turning into a novel here, but lastly I just want to say what incredible people Marc and Mirja are! I've stayed at many bed and breakfasts and I can say that Marc and Mirja's hospitality and graciousness far exceeded anyone else that I've met.

We were told that if you upset patrons in another room you have to pay for their room for that night.  We have travelled and stayed in hotels with our son\u2019s hockey teams for the past 9 years and have never once had a hotel ever tell us that!!\nThe rooms were very dark, the carpets in the rooms were dirty, the rooms were very dated.

They have pre-made omelettes that you can heat up in the microwave, so the one morning we went for breakfast, there was a line-up of people waiting to heat up their omelette, their French toast or their waffle.  There is only 1, very slow, toaster for all patrons; perhaps replace it with a more commercial model that is continuously rotating so you don\u2019t have such long lines for people to make toast.

Very pleasant but misleading as the renovations seemed to have stopped after the reception area. \n\nHallways: Were clean but outdated. Smelled of smoke. I understand that half of the Sandman is still smoker friendly. It shows. \n\nRooms: The first trip we stayed in a room close to the reception. We were on the first floor. The room was clean (but severely outdated) and even though it was a non-smoking room, you could still smell the remnants of it. The windows facing the parking lot were poorly installed\u2014they did not sit on the track properly so there were obvious air leaks. I honestly do not recall if you could open them. The bathrooms were clean but still felt dingy due to several things such as a noisy bathroom fan that really did not get out any of the steam and shower\u002Fbath stalls with poor tile work that seemed to have mould. Apparently being this close to reception gave us good wireless reception. The walls between the rooms are very thin so we heard the guy next to us listening to TV and having his alarm go off at 5am. \n\nWe\u2019ve had an atrium facing room during the summer. Our air conditioner worked fine but we still felt a little confined. You could hear all the noise from the atrium as well. \n\nThe last room we stayed at was at the back of the hotel with poor wireless reception. If you go to the front desk, you will receive a router, which is supposed to help. Ours barely did but it did not matter as we were only in town for a few nights.  The previous comments about the room apply however, this time the window definitely did not open. Our room was really hot so we had to put on the air conditioner. \n\nAll rooms had wicked shower water pressure that felt like it could strip skin. I\u2019m a fan of high water pressure so this was nice to me. Just be careful of your sensitive bits!! \n\nExtreme downsides: No continental breakfast. All the other hotels in the area offer this for the same price of a room at the Sandman. \n\nPool \u002F Spa: Having travelled a fair bit and being in the industry, I\u2019ve started taking my own testing kits. Every time we have stayed at the Sandman, there has never been any chlorine in the pool or spa. This is not something that should be lacking. Knowing this could be a problem on our last trip I stocked up on supplies. Sure enough, there was no chlorine and the PH was low. I complained to the front desk who said they would leave a note for maintenance. The following night I went back to check the readings and nothing had been done. This is a health hazard. I added chemicals myself.\n\nRestaurant in the hotel: We had breakfast, which was over priced and cold. The only thing worthwhile was the toast and fruit. \n\nOverall not unpleasant but not joyous either.

Nelson_data\ca\181791\557216\492279533.html,Canadas Best Value Inn &amp; Suites- Castlegar,"""Hi & welcome to my review;\n\nNever have I seen such poor treatment of guests in a professional establishment.\nI'm a local to the area & was working night shifts so I'm awake during mostly night hours. I showed up, everything seemed fine, the place seemed nice enough. I payed extra for a room with more beds. The manager, who spoke poor English and came from over seas, seemed a bit grumpy but nothing to be concerned about.  I booked the room early, left and returned after my room was cleaned.\n\nIt's now around 8pm, I brought a couple of friends over, we had a 1 or 2 drinks each for a light buzz. The first half of the night was great up until after 11pm. We started getting knocks on the door from the manager, he told me specifically that walking outside of my room to go outside was strictly prohibited after hours as people are sleeping. When walking through the halls outside our room we weren't stomping, we weren't even talking. In fact, before he even showed up we were showing common courtesy for other people by walking as light as we can. While in the room we weren't that quiet but after the warning we were. Even though we followed these prison type rules we were still harassed by the manager. He was able to see into our window and hear us from the balcony, he purposely spied on us all night long and when we went out of the hotel to smoke in my car he stood on the balcony just watching us.\n\nIf your kids are loud, watch out. So here we are, whispering at midnight, tippy toeing around, and constantly watching for the manager out of the window. The TV was louder than we were, the microwave opening and closing was even louder than the TV, but apparently everyone was complaining. Apparently the place was booked right up. I failed to see many parked cars, or even people eating at breakfast, and not many people around in general. It all felt very personal from the manager.\n\nAt this point we felt frustrated a mistreated so our critical thinking got the best of us. We toured the room intensively. We found the stove handle to be extremely loose, felt as if it were to break off at any moment, the organizational skills of the housekeeping was poor but that wasn't very important. One of the walls was not like the others, it was concrete, and on the same wall was a big metal electrical pipe leading to the fire alarm above our heads, it was extremely aesthetically unpleasant. So not only did it feel like a prison, it looked like one as well in the kitchen area. The 2 bedrooms were nice. 1 bed had a door, and the 2 bed had no door and led into the kitchen, though it brought no issues for us. The beds were comfy, the thermostats for each individual room was excellent. At around 1am in the morning the internet was completely cut out and when it showed up again on all of our phones, the password had been changed. Lucky we connected to some random persons internet near by that was not part of the hotel. It was quite poor service but we decided to let it slide and be chill. We had a good couple hours of sleep before checkout.\n\nThis is where things blew my mind. I woke up. I cleaned the place as best I could though it was barely touched in the first place. I went to get my 50 dollar deposit and the manager comes out looking clearly upset. I kind of figured he might be. Even though me & my friends felt invaded & I wanted to complain more than anything I decided to bite my tongue. I politely asked if it was ok I left the digital card keys in the room and collected my deposit. He said of course, then asked if I had been smoking in the room. I replied \""absolutely not\"", he then says he'd like to \""verify this\"". I nodded my head. (He must have assumed we were smoking inside because he seen us smoking in the car. Again, it felt personal. But obviously we were smoking in the car for a reason. Instead of inside the establishment.)\n\nHe returns and doesn't say a word about any smoking, the place was clean as can be. It was respected. The manager then goes into his money closet and as he's opening the cash box he starts telling me how I had a 3rd person in the room so I will be receiving only 35 dollars of my 50, because a 3rd person costs 15 extra dollars. None of that was disclosed when I bought the room, and he said it was obvious. On top of this, I wasn't even aware of my other friend coming back. Overall I was okay with the 15 dollar charge but I put up a debate over it and as he had given me my 35 dollars I was still debating with him over it. He got angry and called me a liar several times and took the 35 dollars back into his hands and said he was keeping it because I lied. I thought this was the most disrespectful and childish thing someone could do and never have I been treated like that at a hotel. He spited me, he raised his voice, and he spoke over me every time I tried to raise a point about something wrong. I wasn't able to voice the problems with the internet, or to even explain myself about my friends being there, even though we didn't sleep. He claimed the beds were all used so 3 people slept when in fact I had just swapped between the 2 beds because I liked bed by the door more. It was all accusation. I proceeded to attempt to explain myself and do myself & my friends some justice though he kept raising his voice higher and higher while saying \""No no no no no\"" and moving his finger around pointing it at me. Then he'd tell me everything I did wrong in repetition. My last stand was letting him know of a hazard on a stair piece coming down from the Emergency Exit. It was a loose stair that I tripped on and twisted my ankle a bit, it still hurts as writing this. I can live with it but I can only imagine someone with less dexterity than me stepping on this as it actually lifts and would cause someone to fall down the stairs and onto the pavement. It's a health concern and I'm thinking about calling health and safety about it if it's unfixed. So, as I brought this up to the manager he immediately shot me down and said that no one is allowed on the stairs of the Emergency Exit. The sign is above the door at the top of the stairs. There was nothing stating I was not allowed to go on the stairs coming from outside. Even though the Emergency Exit was open and I seen other guests going in and out of it. He never ended up addressing the safety of the matter at all and continued to basically mock me & make me and my friends out to be fools of some nature.\n\nAnother small note to add was that the bible in the drawer had a bunch of pages missing, it's a mockery of the religion and we were very unimpressed. So we threw the bible in the garbage before we left.\n\nI got fed up with being talked down to, I was beginning to become truly upset so I said \""look, just give me my 35 dollars and I'm leaving\"", kept it simple and civil.\n\nBut no hotel that I have ever been in has shown it's guests such disrespect & outright mockery. Pennies were being pinched. Management was angry and looking for reasons to be upset.\n\nI came to the hotel to get away from home, though a 30 minute drive away and I could have walked outside of my room with no troubles, had full internet access, and even spoke at normal room volumes without being harassed. I could of went out to my car for a smoke without someone staring at me for the entire duration, and who knows maybe even had a couple more friends over.\n\nI recommend the Canadas Best Value Inn & Suites in Castlegar, B.C. to anyone who prefers a service more degrading than a trailer park Motel. I recommend this establishment to anyone who likes being treated negatively and would enjoy the experience of being posted up in Jail for the night. I recommend it to all those who like being watched as if you are a child at Daycare.\n\nPlease, rent room 521 and see for yourself.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this review, I hope you find it helpful & that it aids you in your choice for Hotel establishments in the future.\n\nP.S.

And our experience is that their hospitality is only the beginning.  Our motorcycle broke down on our first night with them; after suggesting repair possibilities, making phone calls on our behalf, and calling on their own personal friends to help us out, we were still unable to successfully fix our bike, so Ruth (and Steve, their adorable Labradoodle) drove us 65 miles (105 km for those of you north of the border) to Cranbrook where the closest car rental agency was so we could continue our vacation.  Ruth even offered to pick us up again at the end of our trip when we returned our rental car and drive us back to the motel where we were to meet family members to help us get the disabled motorcycle back to the States and the nearest repair shop!  UNBELIEVABLE.  We were virtual strangers to them and they bent over backwards to treat us like friends and help us when our choices looked very limited.

We were going to take a King room but the kind manager, Kerry Hobbs, upgraded us to a King Suite. It was lovely and very much appreciated.\n\nThe location is great.

There are also two PC's available in the Business Center.\n- there's virtually no traffic noise in the room once it's dark outside. Both highway 3 and 3A are somewhat difficult to drive at night so traffic tends to stop when it's dark. Unlike Cranbrook, there's little train traffic, either.  We had a room that faced the highway and didn't hear any traffic at night.\n- the flat screen TV had a good picture and the cable TV channels included TCM, Turner Classic Movies. \n- the restaurant at the hotel's doorstep, Ricky's All Day Grill, makes surprisingly good food for a restaurant chain and it's convenient.

This is a very small dog, shorkie non shedding, about 11 lbs and was just at the groomer the day before for a cut and shampoo etc. They never asked us at check in if we were traveling with a pet. With some confusion I was told the place was Hypo-allergenic, however they have peanut butter in the breakfast eating area, a dog run out back and a sign indicating a dog run out back . I was also told that you could bring your dog but you would have to leave it in the car\u002Ftruck, the dog owner can stay in hotel all covered with hair\u002Ffleas etc which in my opinion is for sure not Hypo-allergenic and also service dogs can stay in hotel according to there web site for the Creston Ramada, how are service dogs any different than any other dog.  They said they would have to wash the walls and not rent the room for 3 days. What a confusing double standard place to stay, people with hair etc on them from traveling with there dog and service dogs can stay there and not have to pay the $500.00 but we had to pay it,they added it to our master card on file, our total was $658.20 for one nights stay, we arrived around 10PM and left the next morning around 9:30 am, we used 1 bed and the bathroom. When i complained about the grossly inflated charge they asked me to speak to the owner, he said he paid several million dollars to build the place and he didnt make any money around here, I finally offered to split the $500.00 with him but he would not even discuss it. They don't have any rooms dedicated to people traveling with pets which a lot of people do, and in my opinion other travelers staying there should be aware if you have any allergies that this place is no more allergenic than any other hotel. Why can't they just ask you if you're traveling with a pet at check in, they would save a lot of confusion but of course you would not stay there and they would be out $150.00 per night and the $500.00 incidential charge.\nFolks there are other great hotels in Creston to stay at when traveling, I am the customer here, never with all the discussion with staff and the owner did I hear a sorry sir or feel they had any concern for the situation or me the paying customer, he finally walked away from us shaking his head and throwing his hands into the air.

My rating was a bit higher I think and the reason is simplification of the breakfast offering. The hotel encourages people to attend Ricky's next door for breakfast now. This encouragement is followed up with a very simplified breakfast here, not competitive with other hotels of similar price structure. This isn't wrong or right, but different.

As for us, we found it a really wonderful stay with really special hosts.\n\nWe were free to use the entire house as well as the grounds. It was a very peaceful spot in the forest which invited us to spend several hours enjoying spectacular vistas of the surrounding mountains. Of course there are mosquitos outside \u2013 what would you expect in the woods ? \u2013 but a simple repellent and a few incense burners are very efficient.\n\nThe Kootenays are a special area in British Columbia. Crawford Bay is very quiet compared to Nelson or Kaslo, which indeed might be a better place if you are seeking vivacity and crowds. We preferred however Crawford Bay and its varied artisans... and went across the lake via the free ferry where we visited the delightful town of Nelson.\nAll the rooms have private baths. We enjoyed our evenings reading a book in the sitting area (both upstairs and downstairs) which was tastefully furnished with a mix of contemporary and ethnic art. \nNancy prepares yummy and generous breakfasts which were served at the front porch. Usually we had some kind of fruit salad, juice and bread, coffee or tea and a daily changing main dish where Nancy proved her culinary imagination.\n\nIf you are looking for a conventional kind of politeness, you better look for a hotel.

The Wedgwood Manor and their hosts, Andre and Nancy, were the delightful surprise that made the whole experience so memorable. We were moved by the way Nancy hosted the study program with enthusiasm and empathy as she led our visit to the nearby Russian immigrant peace community (Dukobors), and to one of several places where Japanese Canadians were interred during and for three years after WWII. \nThe breakfasts were delicious, especially the blueberry cobbler and corned beef hash. There were always vegetarian alternatives. \nThe inn was clean comfortable and part of the early British history of the Koonteneys. We were treated to an historical tour of the manor and grounds, and had a sense of the long traditions of entertainment in the parlor back to the early 20th Century. Art filled the rooms, and represented cultures from around the world. The chandaliers from Russia sparkled in the dining room and entrance lobby, and bold colorful interesting paintings enlivened this old country manor. Recent renovations meant always warm water, comfortable heating, and modern bathroom appointments. But it was the sense of history and many lives (stories) that have known this unique place that is the charm here. \nWe read reviews about the gruff nature of the hosts... yet, we found them welcoming and fully present to us and the other participants in our study program. \nThe really fun extra are the two other hosts: Lucy (a Pekinese and Chihuaua mix!) and Micca, a loving wolfhound.

There was also a 2 piece bathroom on the second floor which was appreciated, especially by my Father. The cabin was not only very clean, but added touches such as the sink in the upper bathroom, stained glass window along the stairs and a perfect night light at the top of the stairs only added to the ambiance. The next morning we awoke to the beauty of the surrounding area. The manor itself is an impressive sight, and the grounds are very well maintained.

Our front room's corner wood trim came off because it was not secure properly.I would hope this will be fix because when the trim landed on the floor,,,nails were sticking out that could poke into someone's foot.Our suite have a bed by the front window and a separate room with a separate bed.We made a HUGE serious mistake by just looking inside quickly and paid right away for two nights without trying the basic functions of the suite...like the bed itself??,..are the sheets and linen are actually clean or mask with fabric spray??...what about the wi-fi....things we took for granted at home . Now most of us as kids had tried once or more on a small or large trampoline for fun. But never ever as adults we would actually sleep on one until now.As we slept as a couple ,the bed is so worn out,service life of the bed was exceeded long time ago....that our bodies roll or slide to toward each other quickly like we are two strong magnets.For a couple of people who are really tired from a long hot day,this situation about the bed won't alleviate any exhaustion  one bit.Since we were so sunk into the center of the bed,I even tried sleeping on the very edge of the bed which I ended up falling off the bed. What about the second bed in the separate room??? Worst than the front room bed.There is no reason for this to happened other then the Inn keeper intentionally leave one suite made for visitors with dog...We ask before but were told that was the only room available for visitors like us with a 4 lb dog who sleeps in his kennel bag anyway. We saw other suites that were empty but were told they have been book during the time we were there. From another review that we had read about this Reno Motel,,,their other suites have been updated, more renovated with good beds.Our suite itself was heavily mask with perfume,the bed sheets and linen seem to have some strong fragrant that trigger my allergy .The wi-fi signal was so weak,it was one or two signal bar drifting to one bar most of time...unless you use your computer right beside the front window, which you might get a three bar signal drifting to two signal bar..Our Inn keeper told us to use a non secure free Telus hot spot which only last for 10 minutes before we have to sign in again with our email,My web browser keep shutting down because of this non secure internet. Our suite has no AC but a wobbly ceiling fan that we thought it might snap off while we slept.All in all Unless they fix those problems .I wholeheartedly advise people to check out this motel's other suits other than our suite number 6 .What we should of done   to save ourselves some grief and money was to sleep in our car and afterward drive anywhere regardless of distant for better accommodation than our experience we had with this motel.",2,negative,"August 31, 2017",123 Railway Ave,Salmo,Kootenay Rockies,V0G 1Z0

We loved so many things about our stay, but we also found so many little, simple things lacking which tipped the scales toward us choosing to not return in the future.\nWe arrived late afternoon after picking up steaks and beer  in Kaslo.  The cabin was very clean, beautifully  styled, and rather spacious.  However, no one had bothered to turn on the refrigerator, so there was no way to cool our steaks or beer.  The kind hostess gladly shared her ice with us, but in a $209 dollar per night cabin couldn't someone have turned on the refrigerator, or maybe even filled our ice bucket since there is no ice machine?  We turned on the electric heat for the night, and the noise in the bedroom was too loud to sleep, cracking and creaking all night long.  We left that room unheated for the remainder of our stay, opting  to heat the bathroom instead.  We loved the private nature of our cabin, but the comfort of the living room furniture was sorely lacking.  We ended up folding blankets under our feet on the little wooden coffee table for comfort.  A couple of Lazy Boys would have been so much better. The romantic lights that came on at night were a pleasant surprise, but the lack of a screen door meant we had to view the scenery from inside or face the hungry insects in the woods.  We stayed an extra night since rain was predicted and we were on motorcycles, and we ventured down the \""trail\"" to the lake.  But our \""walk\"" to the lake turned out to be a hike through dead trees, switchbacks, and dirt.  After being out all day on our last day, we returned to find no room service.  Not a problem since we hadn't thrown our towels on the floor or anything, but the garbage had piled up, there was no coffee or tea, and there was no one at the office.  Two trips walking to the office found it empty, with only a sign that they would be back at 4 PM.  It was now after 6 pm.  So, for over $200 per night, no coffee, no clean towels, and uncomfortable furniture left us wanting a little something more.  We totally agree with other travelers that the hosts are friendly, the area is beautiful, and the cabin was clean, if not well stocked in terms of coffee, tea, or even toilet paper.  This was not a pampered experience, but it was a very private one.  We love the concept of no pets, no smoking, and mostly, no kids.

Beautiful property, stunning views, incredibly peaceful surroundings, cozy cottages, and amazing hospitality. If you want a quiet, relaxing vacation away from all the busyness and stresses of life, this is *THE* place to stay.\n\nOur private, cozy cottage was nestled in nature, where I could just read a book on our porch and be visited by butterflies, robins, hummingbirds, and even a family of deer (and NO mosquitos! At least when we were there), all while taking in breathtaking views and the calming sound of the rushing creek.\n\nThe property has many fruit trees throughout, an orchard, and a lovely winding walk down to a private beach. Note: Walking back up to the cottages provides quite the exercise for out-of-shape folks! There are 4 \""Cedarbrook\"" cottages (numbered as #2 to #5). They are quite small, and are the perfect balance of rustic and luxurious: beautiful wood construction, a wood-burning fireplace, and no TV\u002Finternet (this is a good thing!), while still having a fully-equipped kitchen, drinks & snacks, crystal-clear & clean water, electric heat if needed, bath\u002Fshower & plumbing, and comfy bed. If you want a little more space, there is the slightly larger \""Cedarcrest\"" cottage (#6), which also has some extra amenities, including a TV and your own BBQ.\n\nWe enjoyed the Retreat Centre, where we chose to eat our amazing continental breakfast out on the balcony, and being musicians, played & sang some music (thanks to the keyboard and guitar inside). You can also do yoga, play board games, and access free wi-fi.\n\nI haven't even gotten to the best part: the owners, Debra & Kevin. They manage and take care of the whole place themselves, and are among the nicest and friendliest people we've met. You can tell they really, actually care about this place and about providing you the best possible experience. They went above & beyond with many personalized acts of kindness & hospitality. They were such a joy to chat with and we pretty much just wanted to move in with them :)\n\nWing Creek is only a 5 minute drive from the quaint village of Kaslo, which we loved exploring. There is so much history in Kaslo (which you can tell the people value), lots of great little shops & restaurants, a thriving arts & music scene, watersport opportunities on the pristine Kootenay Lake, and much more. It's also just an hour from Nelson, another fun place to visit.\n\nWe think that Wing Creek Resort is the perfect place for any person or couple to relax, unwind, disconnect from technology, connect with nature, and re-connect with each other.
